    <h1>The World in Darkness&mdash;Examples of Rejection (Part 2)</h1>
</header>
<h1>Samson</h1>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<p>Samson was consecrated to God as a Nazirite from conception and he was to remain so for life [Jdg 13:3-5]. Although
    there were other prohibitions that came along with this consecration [Jdg 13:4], it primarily meant that Samson was
    never to cut the hair on his head. It was as though he was in a covenant with God as long as he did not cut the hair
    on his head.</p>
<p>Samson was filled with the Spirit [Jdg 13:24-25] and was gifted with extraordinary strength by the Spirit of God upon
    him. The Spirit of God would not forsake Samson on any account even when, against the Nazirite regulations, he just
    ate honey from a dead lion [Jdg 14:8-9]. Samson&rsquo;s enemies, the Philistines, whom Samson on several occasions
    had singlehandedly humiliated, sought ways to disarm Samson and sadly they succeeded.</p><!--excerpt.end-->
<p>Samson quite foolishly revealed the source of his strength to his enemies who wasted no time in cutting off his hair
    while he was asleep [Jdg 16:19]. Once his hair was cut, the result of his wayward lifestyle, his consecration to God
    as a Nazirite was broken, his strength left him and he became as weak as any other man. Samson however did not
    realized that Yahweh <em>(the Spirit)</em> had departed from him until he was so easily overpowered and captured by
    his enemies the Philistines [Jdg 16:20]. His enemies quickly put out both his eyes and made him a prisoner employed
    in slave labour [Jdg 16:21] and entertainment [Jdg 16:25].</p>
<p>The Philistines naturally wanting to humiliate their terrible foe, left their blind slave unkempt and with time
    Samson&rsquo;s hair grew [Jdg 16:22] which meant that he could be restored to his consecration to God. Samson called
    on God who restored his supernatural strength to him, his eyes were however still blind and he needed the aid of
    someone to use his strength against his enemies.</p>

<h2>What Changed with Samson&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Having the Holy Spirit</strong>: The LORD <em>(the Spirit of God)</em> departed from him</li>
    <li><strong>Manifestation of the Holy Spirit</strong>: He lost his extraordinary strength and was overpowered by his
        enemies</li>
    <li><strong>Freedom</strong>: He became a slave to the enemies of Israel</li>
    <li><strong>Sight</strong>: He was made blind by his enemies</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Remained the Same In Spite of Samson&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Condition for Consecration</strong>: His hair consecrated him to God; Samson could still call on God
        after his hair grew back.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relevant Lessons</h2>
<p>The fact that Samson&rsquo;s Nazirite relationship to God was restored once his hair was restored highlights a very
    important fact and that is that every relationship is established upon certain conditions. The relationship is
    broken if the condition upon which it is built is destroyed and can be restored anytime the condition is restored,
    if it is one that can be restored.</p>
<p>Also, we can see from Samson&rsquo;s story that even when the condition upon which a broken relationship was built is
    restored, it does not mean that the broken relationship will be automatically restored. Though Samson&rsquo;s hair
    had grown back, he still had to pray to God before his strength could be restored to him [Jdg 16:28].</p>
<p>As we can see from Samson&rsquo;s story, no sin, except it destroys or limits the basis of the relationship,is by
    itself sufficient to bring about estrangement.</p>

<h1>The Rejection of Israel and Judah</h1>
<p>The people and nation of Israel had a special covenant with God by which God alone was to be their God and they were
    to be God&rsquo;s people [Gen 17:7]. This meant that Israel was to worship Yahweh alone and never an idol or any
    other god [Exo 20:2-5<em>a</em>]. Not only was Israel to worship Yahweh, but they were to worship him in the way he
    prescribed. They were also to live righteously and in holiness among the other nations testifying of God&rsquo;s
    righteous and holy character to the other nations around them.</p>
<p>Israel as a people was truly blessed of God and were indeed unlike other nations. God gave them his Spirit, spoke
    with them through his prophets of which they had many, gave them priests and expressly made his will known to them
    through the Law.</p>
<p>Israel however sinned so many times against God and did not observe their consecration to him and though God often
    punished them, he never rejected them as his people, he never withdrew from them those special privileges that made
    them different from others. Nevertheless, after much repeated offences against him, God dealt the severest of blows
    on his people and rejected them.</p>
<h2>Two Nations</h2>
<p>Sometime in its history, God split the nation of Israel in two&mdash;Israel and Judah&mdash;[1Ki 11:30-32] along
    preexisting geopolitical fault lines. He did this basically to reduce the dominion of Solomon and thus punish him.
    This split meant that each half had a different history in its relationship to God and so, though both nations were
    eventually rejected by God for their rebellion, the details of their rejections are not the same.</p>

<h3>Rejecting Israel</h3>
<p>Israel in the north was the first to pervert the worship of God, first, by worshiping him contrary to the stipulated
    regulations of the Law of Moses&mdash;they worshiped Yahweh God through images, in temples of their own design,
    locations of their own choosing [Deut 12:5-6] and used priests who were not Levites [1Ki 11:28-33]. This was bad
    enough but they went further still, worshiping the gods of the surrounding nations [1Ki 17:7-20]. For this, God
    rejected Israel completely exiling them by the hand of the Assyrian king from his land, the land of Israel [2Ki
    18:9-12]. They became foreigners in foreign lands and the king of Assyria ensured that they could not return to
    their land by settling other peoples in the land.</p>

<h3>Rejecting Judah</h3>
<p>While Israel went astray, Judah remained faithful to God and so remained in God&rsquo;s favour much longer.
    Nevertheless, Judah too fell into the terrible sins of idolatry and bloodshed and broke God&rsquo;s Law at many
    points. The Sabbath, which was the sign of the Old Covenant between God and Israel [Exo 31:13] was desecrated, thus
    breaking the Covenant, they even desecrated the temple of God by offering unclean animals upon the altar, worshiping
    idols and other gods in it. For all of this, God rejected them.</p>
<p>Like Israel in the north, Judah too was exiled&mdash;they were exiled to Babylon. At this point, the rejection of
    Israel and Judah is similar but Judah&rsquo;s rejection involved even more because of the greater favor she had
    enjoyed from God. Of all the towns and cities of Israel, God had chosen Jerusalem and Zion [Psa 87:1-2; 132:13-14]
    which were in Judah, and in Jerusalem was God&rsquo;s earthly temple. In Judah also reigned the kings from
    David&rsquo;s line. Judah upon exile lost all of this&mdash;God destroyed his temple which was in Jerusalem and put
    an end to the reign of kings in Judah.</p>
<p>The exile of Israel and Judah is described as casting them out of God&rsquo;s presence [Jer 23:39]</p>

<h3>What Remained the Same In Spite of Israel and Judah&rsquo;s Rejection?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Still Children Of Their Fathers</strong>: They were Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&rsquo;s descendants</li>
    <li><strong>Care from God</strong>: God still cared for them even in exile [Eze 11:16]</li>
    <li><strong>Worship of God</strong>: They were still to worship God [Deut 4:26-29]</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Changed with Israel and Judah&rsquo;s Rejection?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>God&rsquo;s Presence</strong>: They were cast out of God&rsquo;s presence</li>
    <li><strong>Land of Promise</strong>: They lost possession of the land of promise</li>
    <li><strong>Foreigners</strong>: They were foreigners in foreign lands</li>
    <li><strong>Became Subject to Other gods</strong>: They became subject to other powers [2Ki 25:24; Jer 5:19] and
        foreign gods as God had long warned them [Deut 28:36; Jer 16:13]&mdash;since they will not serve Him, he gave
        them over to serve others to see the difference [2Ch 12:8].</li>
    <li><strong>Understanding of God&rsquo;s Word</strong>: Their minds and hearts were cursed&mdash;they were made
        spiritually blind and deaf, so that they are unable to truly understand the things of God [Isa 6:9-10].
        <p>This stops them from being fully restored to God and from being saved [Isa 6:10<em>b</em>]. This is why they
            could not recognize Christ when he came and murdered the very one they had for so long been waiting for.
            This aspect of their rejection has not been overturned but is still in effect and is to continue till the
            second coming of Christ. This is a punishment for them, a retribution for their sins [Rom 11:7-10].</p>
        <p>For this reason, though Israel is so blessed and unlike other nations has the light of God&mdash;the Law of
            Moses and his words to them through his prophets&mdash;they are in the dark having been made blind [1Co
            3:14-15; 4:3-4].</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The spiritual institutions were weakened</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This darkness was partly accomplished by weakening the spiritual and religious offices that promoted the will
            and ways of God among the people. The prophetic ministry was greatly affected, the prophets who were the
            spiritual eyes of the people became blind, they no longer received visions from the LORD, they inquired but
            there were no answers [Isa 29:9-10;Mic 3:6]. Priests and pastors who were the teachers and leaders of the
            people failed in their office and could not properly understand the word of the LORD [Isa 29:11-12
            <em>cf.</em> Rom 11:9-10]. This was however not absolute for there were still prophets among the people,
            however they became more and more few till they became such a rare occurrence among the people.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>God gave them a spirit of deep sleep [Isa 29:9-12]</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>God’s glory departed from the temple [Eze 8:6; 10] and his temple was destroyed
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Presence of God&rsquo;s Glory</strong>: God&rsquo;s glory departed from the temple [Eze 8:6; 10] and his
        temple was destroyed</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relevant Lessons</h3>
<p>As we read through scriptures, we can see that not all who suffered along with Israel and Judah were personally
    guilty; some of these men and women were extremely pious and faithful to God and to his Law. Jeremiah, Daniel,
    Ezekiel and others like them suffered along with Israel in her rejection but were certainly not personally guilty of
    the sins for which God rejected Israel.</p>
<h3>The Spirit in Israel&rsquo;s Story</h3>
<p>God did not reject any of both nations without warning but over and over again, he warned them [1Ki 17:13-14] through
    the prophets by his Holy Spirit in them but they were rebellious and rejected the Holy Spirit [Neh 9:30]. The
    consequence was that he turned and became their enemy [Isa 63:10; Act 7:51]. So the Israelites had the Spirit of God
    among them [Neh 9:20; Isa 63:11-14]</p>
<h3>Judah&rsquo;s Return from Exile</h3>
<p>Judah&rsquo;s exile lasted seventy years after which they were restored to the land. God nevertheless has not fully
    restored them for their return to the land was only partial. The seventy year exile of Judah particularly atoned for
    one sin&mdash;the desecration of the Sabbath [2Chr 36:19-21 <em>cf. </em>Lev 25:1-5; 26:32-35]. It did not cater to
    other sins such as the blood that had been shed [2Ki 24:3-4] which cannot be easily atoned for but by the blood of
    the one who shed it [Joe 3:21 <em>cf.</em> Num 35:33-34]; they were still paying for these bloods even long after
    Jesus&rsquo; atonement [Mat 23:35-38].</p>
