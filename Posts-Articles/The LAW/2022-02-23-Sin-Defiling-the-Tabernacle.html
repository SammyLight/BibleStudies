    <h1>Sin Defiles the Tabernacle</h1>
</header>
    <!--excerpt.start--><p>The Tabernacle needed to be cleansed once a year on the Day of Atonement because it was defiled by the sins of the Israelites [Lev 16:16].</p><!--excerpt.end-->
    <ol>
        <li>The Tabernacle was defiled by the uncleanness of the Israelites in whose midst it was [Lev 15:31; 16:16].</li>
        <li>The defilement of a member of the community defiled the Tabernacle [Num 19:13; 35:34]</li>
        <li>The Altar was cleansed from the sins of the Israelites with blood on the Day of Atonement [Lev 16:19]</li>
    </ol>
<h1>How Was the Tabernacle of Yahweh Defiled by the Sins of the Israelites?</h1>
<!-- <em>It may seem strange at first that the Tabernacle could be defiled by sin, but if it couldn't, there wouldn't have been strict laws against defiling it.</em>
<em>(The Tabernacle can be defiled by sin, for example, if the sins had been committed in it, it would have certainly been defiled.)</em>-->
<ol>
    <li>Just as the land is defiled by blood [Num 35:33; Psa 106:38], so too, it is defiled by sin.
        <ol>
            <li>The land of Canaan was, for example, defiled by forbidden sexual relations of its inhabitants [Lev 18:24-28]
                <ol>
                    <li>Sexual relations dishonoring close relatives, with animals, or homosexual relations [Lev 18:6-24]</li>
                    <li>A man taking his divorced wife back after she had married another man [Deut 24:4; Jer 3:1]</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>A man who hangs on a tree is cursed and if he remains on the tree overnight, the land itself will be defiled [Deut 21:23]</li>
            <li>Idolatry defiles the land [Jer 3:9]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>A defiled house or tent makes those in it unclean [Lev 14:44-47]</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, since the land was defiled by the sins of the people living in it, the Tabernacle being in the same land among the Israelites was defiled by their sins.</p>
