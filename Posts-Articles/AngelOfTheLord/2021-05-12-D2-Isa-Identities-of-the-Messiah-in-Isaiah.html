<header><h1>Identities of the Messiah in Isaiah</h1></header>
<p>The following identifies the Messiah through acts, attributes and various description of Him in the prophecy of Isaiah the prophet.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Who will save Jersualem from the Assyrian invasion? <em>All those listed below are prophesied by Isaiah to deliver Jerusalem from Judah. Since they all play the same role of delivering Jerusalem from Assyria, it means that they are the same person. The Names (and titles) are just different aliases for the same person.</em>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Immanuel</strong> [Isa 8:6-10]&mdash;<em>although it is clear, just from reading Isaiah alone, that the Immanuel is actually the Messiah, the Matthew confirms this since he identifies Jesus the Messiah as the prophesied Immanuel [Mat 1:20-21,22-23]</em></li>

	<li>He will be born and grow as a man&mdash;a divine being that becomes a human
		<ol>
			<li>The <strong>Arm of Yahweh</strong> [Isa 53:1-2]<em> (The Arm of Yahweh is certainly a divine being, Isaiah prophesies about death. Since he has to be a man to be able to die, it means that he became a man.)</em></li>
			<li><strong>Immanuel</strong> [Isa 7:14-17; 8:6-10] <em>(The name Immanuel means, &ldquo;God with us&ldquo;. While this may have just be figurative, it is confirmed to be literal by the fact that he is actually the Arm of Yahweh and by the connection to the Angel of Yahweh who fulfilled the prophecy about Immanuel delivering Jerusalem from the Assyrian invasion)</em></li>
			<li>The <strong>Son born to David&rsquo;s house</strong> [Isa 9:6] <em>(while the prophesied Son of David may have seemed to be an ordinary man special only because he was chosen to be the Messiah, David&rsquo;s heir, his prophesied name, &ldquo;Mighty God</em>&rdquo; <em>tells us that he actually is a divine being)</em></li>
