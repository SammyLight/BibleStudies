<h1>Misconception and Distractions</h1>
<!--excerpt.start--><p>Too many times, when Jesus&rsquo; parables are read and taught, their true meanings are ignored as they are interpreted from a purely human point of view. Now, although such messages derived from Jesus&rsquo; parables may not be wrong in themselves, they
    are nevertheless not the messages Jesus intended to communicate to us through his parables. As faithful disciples, our first and ultimate goal in studying Jesus&rsquo; words and parables should be to discover and understand what he meant exactly.</p><!--excerpt.end-->
<p>Surely, God cares about us, yet it is important to emphasize that Jesus&rsquo; interest in teaching was not to give us a better life, to make us richer and more comfortable and other such things. No! His purpose was to teach about His Kingdom.</p>
<p>For example, it is wrong to think that Jesus was teaching his disciples about</p>
<ul>
    <li>business and making money in the parables of talents and minas, or</li>
    <li>marriage and weddings when his parable involved weddings or marriages, or</li>
    <li>how to build a house when he spoke about building on the rock and not on sand, or</li>
    <li>quantity surveying when he spoke about counting the cost before undertaking a project.</li>
    <li>Jesus was surely not teaching his disciples to be thieves when he said he would come like a thief in the night nor to add sin to sin like the shrewd manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although some of these parables are built on certain universally acknowledged principles, which would be good for us to master and would be very useful us personally, we must nevertheless understand that teaching us these principles in themselves was
    not Jesus&rsquo; goal. It is good for example to count the cost and plan properly before undertaking any project, but this was not in itself Jesus&rsquo; message when he spoke about counting the cost. No, Jesus was teaching us to count the cost of
    being his disciple so as to be well prepared in heart to make the necessary sacrifices when they were demanded.</p>
<p>Let us not be distracted by any principle upon which the message in a parable rests nor by the practices described in a parable such as wedding, farming, harvest etc. Let us rather ask ourselves, &ldquo;What exactly did Jesus have in mind to communicate
    to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today we will be carrying out class exercises as we study Jesus&rsquo; parables in Matthew 13</p>
<h1>Matthew 13 Parables</h1>
<p>Jesus explained some of his parables to his disciples, and these are keys to understanding the parables he did not explain. There are eight parables in Mat 13, Jesus explained three of these eight parables and these will serve as our guide to interpreting
    the other five.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Parable of the Sower&nbsp;</strong>[Mat 13:3-9&nbsp;<em>explained in&nbsp;</em>Mat 13:18-23]</li>
    <li><strong>Parable of weeds in a field&nbsp;</strong>[Mat 13:24-30&nbsp;<em>explained in&nbsp;</em>Mat 13:37-43]</li>
    <li>Parable of the mustard seed [Mat 13:31-32&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;<em>explained</em>]</li>
    <li>Parable of yeast [Mat 13:33&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;<em>explained</em>]</li>
    <li>Parable of treasure hidden in a field [Mat 13:49&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;<em>explained</em>]</li>
    <li>Parable of the pearl of great value [Mat 13:45&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;<em>explained</em>]</li>
    <li><strong>Parable of the net&nbsp;</strong>[Mat 13:47-50&nbsp;<em>partly</em>&nbsp;<em>explained</em>]</li>
    <li>Parable of old and new treasures [Mat 13:31-32&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;<em>explained</em>]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gaining Perspective</h2>
<p>The message of the Kingdom as presented by Jesus in his parables is a story, an unfolding story.</p>
<p>Basically, every story has actors who perform the different actions in that story. Every story has locations where the events and actions of its actors take place. The actors and locations and other objects in a story have direct and indirect relationships
    and interactions which bring about the actions and events that the story tells. Every story also has locations, places where events take place. Stories also have beginnings and endings, they happen over time.</p>
<p>As we study his parables, let us keep an eye on such questions crucial to understanding any story such as: who? Where? When? Why? How?</p>
<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
<p>First, read the three parables Jesus explained and understand their explanations. Discuss them.&nbsp;<em>(The tables below are to serve as guides.)</em></p>
