<h1>Key Points</h1>
<h2>Times of Reward</h2>
<!--excerpt.start--><p>Rewards in Jesus&rsquo; parables are generally found at the end of the age when Jesus comes. This period is also called the regeneration or the renewal of all things [Mat 19:28&nbsp;<em>cf.</em>&nbsp;Isa 65:17; 66:22; Act 3:21; 2Pe 3:13; Rev 21:5&nbsp;<em>consider also&nbsp;</em>1Co
    15:25-28]</p><!--excerpt.end-->
<p>Nevertheless, before the end of the age, there are rewards the faithful servants of the Lord Jesus Christ are entitled to, primarily, the answer to prayers [Joh 15:7,16]. Jesus taught us to pray for the forgiveness of sins, which not only concerns the
    age to come but even this present age, our daily bread, exemption from trials and deliverance from all evil, etc. Apart from these, there is a request that Jesus particularly asks us to persistently ask for till we receive it. This request is for
    the gift<em>s</em>of the Holy Spirit [Mat 7:11&nbsp;<em>cf.&nbsp;</em>Luk 11:13;&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;<em>are to ask for the gift of God</em>&nbsp;Joh 4:10&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;which is the Holy Spirit&nbsp;</em>Joh 7:38-39; Act 1:4-5; 2:38].</p>
<h2>Two Periods of Punishment</h2>
<p>Just as with rewards, we can group the times in which punishments occur in Jesus&rsquo; parables&nbsp;<em>(and teachings)</em>&nbsp;into two,</p>
<ol>
    <li>Before the end of the age</li>
</ol>
<p>e.g., the rich fool whose life God required because of his pride, the rich man who was tormented in Hades [Luk 16:19-31, the unmerciful servant [Mat 18:32-35]</p>
<ol>
    <li>At the end of the age</li>
</ol>
<p>e.g., the weeds or the unrighteous that will cast into the fiery furnace [Mat 13:40-42, 49-50], the goats separated from the sheep [Mat 25:31,41]</p>
<h2>Requirements for Reward</h2>
<p>Everyone who faithfully serves the Lord Jesus in accordance with his will can be sure of a reward. However, our rewards will not be the same but will be dependent on God&rsquo;s call and our labour and sacrifice. As long as we are not hypocrites and are
    forgiving of our brothers, our righteous works and labour in the tasks the Lord assigns to us will all be rewarded.</p>
<p>In other words, we are servants and what our Lord will reward is our loyalty and devotion to him, and our sacrifice and diligent hard work in the tasks he assigns us to. Our Lord Jesus has no reward but shameful rejection for hypocritical and unserious
    Christians.</p>
<p>The following are some of the requirements for reward as described in Jesus&rsquo; parables.</p>
<ol>
    <li>God&rsquo;s choice [<em>Hired Labourers&nbsp;</em>Mat 20:16,23&nbsp;<em>although our labour matters, it is God who will determine our reward</em>]</li>
    <li>Invitation through the gospel [Mat 22:3-4,9]</li>
    <li>Faith in Christ Jesus as Lord [Mat 7:21; 8:10-11]</li>
    <li>Righteousness&nbsp;<em>(works)</em>&nbsp;that surpass that of the Pharisees and teachers of the Law; obeying the teachings and commands of the Lord Jesus [Mat 5:19]</li>
    <li>Hard work and diligence, you cannot be lazy and expect a reward, you must be faithful to the task the Lord Jesus commits to you [Mar 13:32-37]</li>
    <li>Spiritual maturity, not being worldly [<em>the ground with thorns vs. the good soil&nbsp;</em>Luk 8:14-15] but loving the Lord above our needs, money and pleasure [Mat 6:24; Luk 14:33]</li>
    <li>Loving our brothers in Christ [<em>feeding the hungry, visiting the sick and those in prison</em>&nbsp;Mat 25:40,45]</li>
    <li>Generosity [Luk 18:22]</li>
    <li>Forgiveness and mercy [Mat 18:32-35]</li>
    <li>Persistence in prayer [<em>importunate friend&nbsp;</em>Luk 11:5-9]</li>
</ol>
<h2>Rewards in Jesus' Parables</h2>
<p>The following are some of the rewards and benefits described in the parables and teachings of our Lord Jesus for God&rsquo;s people,</p>
<ol>
    <li>Adoption as God&rsquo;s children [<em>Wheat, the righteous&nbsp;</em>Mat 13:43]</li>
    <li>Glory, shinning like the sun [<em>Wheat, the righteous&nbsp;</em>Mat 13:43]</li>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Ultimately, our reward is eternal life, glory and full citizenship and access to heaven, authority and dominion. If we want these, we must love our brothers and be forgiving from the heart. We must be spiritual mature, rejecting this world and its ways
    and loving our Lord more than we love comfort and pleasures and our very own lives&mdash;we must be ready to give up for him anything we may have to.</p>
<p>We must take whatever task we are given seriously, for failure and to depart from any of these, is to be sure of total and eternal loss.</p>
