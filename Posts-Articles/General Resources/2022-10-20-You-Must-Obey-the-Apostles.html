    <h1>You Must Obey the Apostles</h1>
</header>

<h1>God&rsquo;s people and the Knowledge of God&rsquo;s ways and word</h1>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<blockquote>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline. [Pro 1:7]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>&ldquo;...my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. &ldquo;Because you have rejected knowledge, I also
    reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.&rdquo;
    [Hos 4:6]</blockquote>
<!--excerpt.end-->
<blockquote>So, as the Holy Spirit says: &ldquo;Today, if you hear his voice, <sub>8</sub>do not harden your hearts as
    you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert, <sub>9</sub>where your fathers tested and tried
    me and for forty
    years saw what I did. <sub>10</sub>That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, &lsquo;Their hearts are
    always going astray, and they have not known my ways.&rsquo; <sub>11</sub>So I declared on oath in my anger,
    &lsquo;They
    shall never enter my rest.&rsquo;&rdquo; [Heb 3:7-11]</blockquote>
<blockquote>We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn. <sub>12</sub>In
    fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of
    God&rsquo;s word all over again.
    You need milk, not solid food! <sub>13</sub>Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with
    the teaching about righteousness. <sub>14</sub>But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained
    themselves
    to distinguish good from evil. [Heb 5:11-14]</blockquote>
<blockquote>&ldquo;For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, and from his mouth men should seek instruction
    because he is the messenger of Yahweh of Hosts. <sub>8</sub>But you have turned from the way and by your teaching
    have caused many
    to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi,&rdquo; says Yahweh of Hosts. [Mal 2:7-8]</blockquote>
<h1>The Father about listening to and obeying Jesus&mdash;the Father about our relationship to
    Jesus</h1>
<blockquote>And a voice from heaven said, &ldquo;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.&rdquo; [Mat
    3:17]</blockquote>
<blockquote>While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, &ldquo;This is
    my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!&rdquo; [Mat 17:5]</blockquote>
<blockquote>For Moses said, &lsquo;The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people;
    you must listen to everything he tells you. <sub>23</sub>Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut
    off from among his
    people.&rsquo; [Act 3:22-23; Deu 18:18-19]</blockquote>
<blockquote>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, &ldquo;If you hold to my teaching, you are really my
    disciples. <sub>32</sub>Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&rdquo; [Joh 8:31-32]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God&rsquo;s
    wrath remains on him.&rdquo; [Joh 3:36]</blockquote>
<h1>Jesus about listening to and obeying his apostles&mdash;Jesus about our relationship to his apostles and
    prophets</h1>
<blockquote>You did not choose me, but <u>I chose you and appointed you</u> to go and bear fruit&mdash;fruit that will
    last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. [Joh 15:16]</blockquote>
<blockquote>&ldquo;He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me.&rdquo; [Mat
    10:40; Luk 10:16]</blockquote>
<blockquote>&ldquo;My prayer is not for them alone. <u>I pray also for those who will believe in me through their
        message</u>&hellip;&rdquo; [Joh 17:20]</blockquote>
<blockquote>Remember the words I spoke to you: &lsquo;No servant is greater than his master.&rsquo; If they persecuted
    me, they will persecute you also. <u>If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours
        also</u>. <sub>21</sub>They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent
    me. [Joh 15:20-21]</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;But <u>the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to
            listen to me</u>, for the whole house of Israel is hardened and obstinate.&rdquo; [Eze 3:7]</em>
</blockquote>
<h1>The Apostles on holding to and deviating from their message</h1>
<blockquote>Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation [1Pe2:2]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach <u>a gospel other than the one we preached to
        you</u>, let him be eternally condemned! <sub>9</sub>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is
    preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned! [Gal 1:8-9]</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bear in mind that our Lord&rsquo;s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you
    with the wisdom that God gave him. <sub>16</sub>He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these
    matters. <u>His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant
        and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction</u>. [2Pe 3:15-16]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them.
    <sub>6</sub><u>We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us</u>; but whoever is not from God does not listen
    to us. <u>This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of
        falsehood</u>. [1Jo 4:5-6]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>He must <u>hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught</u>, so that he can encourage others
    by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. [Tit 1:9]</blockquote>
<blockquote>Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world.
    Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. <sub>8</sub>Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked
    for, but that you
    may be rewarded fully. <sub>9</sub>Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not
    have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. <sub>10</sub>If anyone comes to you and
    does
    not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him. <sub>11</sub>Anyone who welcomes him shares
    in his wicked work. [2Jo 1:7-11]</blockquote>
<blockquote>I want you to <u>recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our
        Lord and Savior through your apostles</u>. [2Pe 3:2]</blockquote>
