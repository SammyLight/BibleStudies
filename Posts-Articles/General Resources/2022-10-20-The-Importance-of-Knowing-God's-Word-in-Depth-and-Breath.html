    <h1>The Importance of Knowing God&rsquo;s Word in Depth and Breath</h1>
</header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<p>We gain wisdom by giving attention to the deeds and words of God. We are to ponder all his works and not some of it.
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>We do not have an example in the Scriptures, neither from Christ nor the apostles of refusal to grow in
            the knowledge of God&rsquo;s word.</strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Distinguishing mark of God&rsquo;s people in the eyes of heaven</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus declared Peter to be blessed because the Father had given Peter revelation of whom Jesus was [Mat
                16:17].
                <ol>
                    <li>Now, it is very important to note that it was not because Peter knew that Jesus was the Son of
                        God in particular that he was blessed but because the Father had chosen to reveal it to him.
                        Jesus did not say, &ldquo;You are blessed because
                        you know that I am the Son of God&rdquo; but instead, &ldquo;You are blessed because the Father
                        revealed it to you.&rdquo;</li>
                    <li>There was no way he could have known that Jesus was the Son of God except the Father had
                        revealed it to him. Therefore, Peter was favored of God. Peter was blessed of God above the
                        other disciples.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, <strong>one of the ways that heaven recognizes those that God has blessed, or in other words has
            given grace, is by the revelation of truth given to them</strong>. Now, someone may think, &ldquo;So
        what?&rdquo;. Well, those God gives grace
        are those He has chosen as His own.</li>
    <li>For the believer, this is a sign that he is elect of God.</li>
    <li>According to our Master Jesus, we are sanctified by the Truth [Joh 17:17].
        <ol>
            <li>We are set apart from the people of the world, the people that God has not chosen, the people who have
                not been given to Jesus&mdash;we are set apart from them by the Truth of God&rsquo;s word. In other
                words, heaven recognizes God&rsquo;s
                people by the Truth of God&rsquo;s word which they possess.</li>
            <li>Now, it is important to note that the Truth of God which sanctifies us works together with the atonement
                of Jesus. It was by the death and ascension of Jesus to God that Jesus set himself apart to God, and he
                said he was about to do that so
                that we would be truly sanctified by the truth of God&rsquo;s word. The implication is this, simply
                believing in the Lord Jesus is not sufficient to sanctify us, to distinguish us before heaven as
                God&rsquo;s people if we do not have the
                Truth of God with us.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Knowledge of the secret things of God is a mark of those who are worthy to be kings in the Kingdom of God [Pro
        25:2]</li>
    <li>Shallow knowledge of God&rsquo;s Kingdom is a mark of those that God has not really chosen&mdash;the secrets of
        the Kingdom are revealed to those that God has chosen [Mat 13:10-12]</li>
    <li><strong>It is required for fruitfulness according to God and Christ&rsquo;s standard.</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>A scribe is one who is one who knows the scriptures well. Therefore, it is significant that Jesus says
                that, &ldquo;every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
                householder, which bringeth forth
                out of his treasure things new and old.&rdquo; [Mat 13:52]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>It is important for doing the will of God</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>It is through wisdom and spiritual understanding that we are filled with the knowledge of God&rsquo;s
                will
                <blockquote>For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to
                    desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
                    understanding; [Col 1:9]</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>A guard against error</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Jesus stated that the Sadducees were in error because they did not know the Scriptures nor the
                        power of God [Mat 22:29; Mar 12:24]</li>
                    <li>The things God revealed are necessary for us to obey God&rsquo;s laws [Deut 29:29 cf., Heb 8:10]
                    </li>
                    <li>Apart from errors that are simply born out of mischief and ulterior motives, many, if not all,
                        of the errors that have arisen in the church, have arisen because some matter was not thoroughly
                        and deeply understood. For example, if
                        there had been a well-articulated description of the relationship between God the Father and
                        Jesus Christ His Son in the Church, the troubles surrounding the rise of the trinity doctrine
                        wouldn&rsquo;t have arisen, and even if
                        they did, they would have been far easier to deal with. Our refusal to understand all that God
                        has concealed for us in Scriptures to understand, is guarantee of heresies.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>God demands that we know his ways, that we know and understand his works and decrees.</strong>
        <ol>
            <blockquote>&ldquo;But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am
                the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I
                delight, saith the LORD. [Jer 9:24]</blockquote>
            <li>This knowledge comes from understanding the acts and judgments of God through time and is not something
                we simply declare, &ldquo;I understand and know the LORD&rdquo;.</li>
            <li>God expects His people to ponder His works, decrees/words and deeds. Those who do not ponder the ways of
                God, his deeds and judgements are rejected by God
                <ol>
                    <li>Those who do not know the thoughts of God,
                        who give no attention to His works are regarded by heaven as fools</li>
                    <blockquote>O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep. <sup>[6]</sup><u>A
                            brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this</u>.[Psa
                        92:5-6]</blockquote>
                    <li>Part of why Israel went into exile was because of this</li>
                    <blockquote>And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but
                        <u>they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands</u>.
                        <sup>[13]</sup>Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and
                        their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried
                        up with thirst. [Isa 5:12-13]
                    </blockquote>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>To not learn the ways of God is considered turning back from God.
        <blockquote>Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: [Job 34:27]</blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>As God&rsquo;s people, we are called to bear witness of God to the world through knowledge of His decrees, i.e.,
        prophecies [Isa 43:10<em>ff</em>].</li>
    <li><strong>It is a sin not to grow in the knowledge of God&mdash;it is a sin to refuse to know what God wants us to
            know</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Refusal to grow in the knowledge of God&rsquo;s word is a form of subtracting from God&rsquo;s word
                which is of no small consequence [Rev 22:18-19].
                <ol>
                    <li>It is one thing to fail to teach what one ought to teach God&rsquo;s people because he sincerely
                        does not know. It is, however, another matter to fail to teach God&rsquo;s people what they
                        ought to know because one deliberately
                        refuses to know what one ought to know or to withhold that which one knows.</li>
                    <li>God who gave us the Scriptures gave them to us to learn and teach them according to the Truth of
                        the Gospel. To be selective in what we chose to learn from God&rsquo;s word is an insult to the
                        wisdom of God&mdash;would God give
                        us if we didn&rsquo;t need them. It is an insult to the authority of God&mdash;God designed the
                        syllabus, He is supposed to be our teacher [Joh 6:45; Isa 54:13], it is rejection of His
                        authority to say we don&rsquo;t need parts
                        of the syllabus.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>God desires to show us things we know not of
                <blockquote>Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou
                    knowest not.&rdquo; [Jer 33:3]</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>God finds a way to cut off those who refuse to grow in the knowledge of His word&mdash;what the little
                they have is taken away from them [Mat 13:10-12]. In other words, they will end up in error. Please take
                note that these are Jesus&rsquo;
                words, and His words will not go unfulfilled [Mat 24:35].</li>
            <li>Hebrews quite plainly warns that those who refuse to grow in the knowledge of God&rsquo;s word will be
                destroyed in the end [Heb 6:7-8,1-6].</li>
            <li>Why would God give us so much in the Scriptures if he did not want us to really know Scriptures? Of
                course, it is because He wants us to know the Scriptures that He gave them to us.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The Apostles</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Commanded to grow in knowledge
                <blockquote>&hellip;add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge [2Pe 1:5]</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in
                    understanding be men. [1Co 14:20]</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><em>(The apostles)</em> Prayed and desired that we grow in knowledge
                <blockquote>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in
                    all judgment; [Php 1:9]</blockquote>
                <blockquote>For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you,
                    and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and
                    spiritual understanding; [Col 1:9]</blockquote>
