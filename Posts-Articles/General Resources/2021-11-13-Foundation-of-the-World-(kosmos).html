<h1>Word Definitions</h1>
<h2>Words Often Translated &ldquo;World&rdquo; in the New Testament</h2>
<h3>&Kappa;&omicron;́&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;, kosmos, G2889:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Strong&rsquo;s Definition: Probably from the base of G2865; orderly <em>arrangement</em>, that is, <em>decoration</em>; by implication the <em>world</em> (in a wide or narrow sense, including its inhabitants, literally or figuratively [morally]): - adorning,
        world.</li>
    <li>G2865&mdash;&kappa;&omicron;&lambda;&upsilon;&mu;&beta;&alpha;́&omega;, kolumbaō: From a primary word &kappa;&omicron;&lambda;&upsilon;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf; kolumbos (to tend, that is, take care of); properly to provide for, that is, (by implication)
        to carry off (as if from harm; generally obtain): - bring, receive.</li>
    <li>Peter describes the beautification of a woman as her <em>kosmos</em>&mdash;&ldquo;Whose adorning <em>(kosmos)</em> let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;&rdquo; [1Pe 3:3]. This confirms <em>kosmos</em> as
        an arrangement, an ordering of things.</li>

<h1>Foundation of the World<em> (kosmos) </em>vs. Foundation of the Earth</h1>
<p>Below I will like to demonstrate and lay out some facts showing that &ldquo;the foundation of the earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;the foundation of the world&rdquo; are different.</p>
<h2>The Earth and the World <em>(kosmos)</em> are not the Same</h2>
<p>First, the world <em>(kosmos) </em>is not the earth, rather the earth is a part of the world <em>(kosmos)</em>.</p>
<ol>
    <li><em>The laying of</em> the foundation of the world speaks of the creation of heaven and earth, it is about the ordering of the heavens and earth created in Genesis 1. Therefore, the earth is only a part of the world <em>(kosmos)</em> and not all that
        the world is.</li>
    <li>The word &lsquo;world&rsquo; in the New Testament is <strong>&kappa;&omicron;́&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</strong>, <em>Kosmos</em> in Greek. In the Greek language <em>(and mythology)</em>, <em>(and, more importantly, as used in the Bible) kosmos </em>refers
        to the universe, i.e., the earth and the stars, and includes the inhabitants of the earth. This is equivalent to what was created in Genesis 1 in the beginning&mdash;the heavens and earth.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The World <em>(kosmos)</em> Does Not Include the Heaven of God</h2>
<p>Second, the world <em>(kosmos) </em>does not include the heaven of God.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Jesus often spoke of the heaven where he came from and where he was returning to as not being a part of this world <em>(kosmos)</em> [Joh 16:28].</li>
    <li>Also, from the fact that the world <em>(kosmos) </em>is sinful [Joh 1:29; 16:8; Rom 5:12], heaven, the heaven of God, cannot be a part of it because the will of God is done in heaven [Mat 6:9-10].</li>
    <li>This <em>kosmos</em> will pass away [1Co 7:31]</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <ol>
        <li>The heaven of God will endure forever [Psa 89:29], yet there are heavens that will be changed [Heb 1:10-12; 2Pe 3:7,10].</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<h3>The Heaven of God and the Kosmos</h3>
<ol>
    <li>There are heavens and not just one heaven.</li>
    <li>God dwells in heaven</li>
    <li>Jesus came from the heaven where God dwells</li>
    <li>God&rsquo;s will is done in <em>(God&rsquo;s) </em>heaven</li>
    <li><em>(Unlike God&rsquo;s heaven) </em>The kosmos is sinful</li>
    <li>The kosmos will pass away</li>
    <li>There is a heavens that will pass away, that will be renewed with fire <em>(will God&rsquo;s heaven be renewed with fire? God&rsquo;s heaven is righteous, so why would it need renewal?)</em>
        <ol>
            <li>Paul speaks of Christ reconciling things in heaven [Col 1:20] <em>(does the heaven of God need reconciliation?)</em>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The kosmos Peter describes that will be destroyed [2Pe 3:6] according to him includes the heavens and the earth [2Pe 3:7-13]</li>
</ol>
<h2>The World <em>(kosmos)</em> Includes the Principalities and Powers</h2>
<p>Third, since the world <em>(kosmos)</em> includes the heavens of the earth, it therefore includes the principalities and powers.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Satan is the prince of the power of the air [Eph 2:1-2]</li>
    <li>The heavenly bodies&mdash;the sun, moon and stars&mdash;were given over to the nations for idolatry [Deu 4:19]. The heavenly bodies are involved in the idolatry of men.</li>
    <li>The rulers of the darkness of this world are said to be in heavenly places [Eph 6:12]</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, we can see that the heavens of the <em>kosmos </em>are sinful.</p>
<h2>Other Deductions</h2>
<h3>When The Foundation of the World (kosmos) Was Laid</h3>
<p>The laying of the foundation of the world <em>(kosmos)</em> lasted from the creation of light up to the division of nations.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Starting with the beginning of creation [Joh 17:5<em> cf., </em>Joh 1:1-3; Gen 1]
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus had glory with God before the world/kosmos &ldquo;began&rdquo; [Joh 17:5]</li>
            <li>God loved Jesus and gave him glory before the &ldquo;founding&rdquo; of the world [Joh 17:14]</li>
            <li>Deduction
                <ol>
                    <li>The beginning and founding of the world are the same things.</li>
                    <li>God loved Jesus and gave him glory before the founding/beginning of the world.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Including the seven days of creation [Gen 1; Heb 4:3]</li>
    <li>including the time of Adam&rsquo;s transgression when sin entered the world [Heb 9:26<em> there would have been no need for the atonement if sin had not entered the world&mdash;sin entered the world through Adam&rsquo;s transgression </em><em>Rom 5:12</em><em>. Jesus would have had to die many times since the laying of the foundation of the world</em>]</li>
    <li>Up to the time of the death of Abel <em>(since he was the first martyr) </em>at the hands of Cain [Luk 11:50-51]</li>
    <li>Up to the division of men into nations.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>In Dan 12:1 we read of <em>&ldquo;the beginning of nations&rdquo;</em> but</li>
        <li>In Mat 24:21 we read of <em>&ldquo;the beginning of the world (i.e., kosmos</em>)&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Therefore, the beginning of the world <em>(kosmos) </em>clearly includes the beginning of nations.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<h3>Some other Facts Related to the Laying of the Foundation of the World</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The kingdom of God was prepared since the foundation of the world <em>(kosmos)</em> was laid [Mat 25:34]</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>God the Father loved Jesus before the foundation of the world was laid <em>(the beginning of the world)</em> [Joh 17:24]</li>
    <li>Christ was chosen before the foundation of the world [1Pe 1:20]</li>
    <li>We were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world [Eph 1:4]</li>
    <li>Names are written in the lamb&rsquo;s book of life from the foundation of the world [Rev 17:8]</li>
    <li>We were destined for glory before time/the world <em>(&alpha;&iota;̓&omega;́&nu; (aiōn G165) i.e., before this age)</em> began [1Co 2:7]</li>
    <li>There are things that have been hidden, and only revealed in parables, since the <em>laying of the </em>foundation of the world/<em>kosmos</em> [Psa 78:1-2; Hos 12:10; Mat 13:34-35]
        <ol>
            <li>The purposes and plans of God from the creation of the world are not plainly stated in scripture but mostly contained in parables</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Eternal life was promised us before the world began [Tit 1:2]</li>
</ol>
<h3>Time Before the Age Began and The Time of the Founding of the Kosmos</h3>
<p>Apparently, time &ldquo;...before the age began&rdquo; corresponds to the foundation of the <em>kosmos</em> [cf., Eph 1:4].</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, our glorification means that we are made sons of God&mdash;it is sons that God glorifies [Heb 2:7].</li>
    <li>Now, Paul here says that we were destined for glory before the &ldquo;age began&rdquo; [1Co 2:7]. Therefore, our choosing as sons was before the age began.</li>
    <li>In his letter to the Ephesians, however, Paul states that we were predestined for adoption as sons before &ldquo;the foundation of the <em>kosmos</em>&rdquo; [Eph 1:4].
        <ol>
            <li>By choosing us in Christ, God had effectively predestined us to be adopted as His sons and thus had predestined us for glory [Eph 1:4-6 <em>cf., </em>Heb 2:7; Rom 8:29-30,21,23]&mdash;our Father is glorious [Eph 1:17] <em>(and so we too must)</em> and
                our inheritance as sons of God is &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; [Eph 1:18].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, time &ldquo;...before the age began&rdquo; corresponds to the foundation of the <em>kosmos</em>&mdash;the age began with the founding of the <em>kosmos</em>.</li>
</ol>
