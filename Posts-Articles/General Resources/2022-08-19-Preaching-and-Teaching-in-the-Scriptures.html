    <h1>Original Language Word Study Deductions in Summary</h1>
    <h2>Preaching</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A preacher is either
            <ol>
                <li>One addressing an assembly delivering a message from above or teaching the assembly.</li>
                <li>A herald sent to make an announcement or deliver some message</li>
                <li>One bringing good news</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>To preach is to be a herald. This requires that he be sent with/by a higher authority with a message to a people. To disobey him is to reject the authority he is speaking by.</li>
        <li>To preach is to make an authoritative declaration, therefore, preaching requires authority. This authority comes either
            <ol>
                <li>By appointment
                    <ol>
                        <li>Directly from God/the Lord Jesus Christ or</li>
                        <li>From one appointed by Jesus, e.g., Timothy and Titus and others who were sent by Paul to teach in the churches and to carry out certain commands. The apostles in Jerusalem also spoke of men who went from them without their authorization
                            [Act 15:24] and who then sent chosen men to go with Barnabas and Paul [Act 15:25].</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>By learning. According to Jesus&rsquo; word, a scribe, that is one that is learned in scriptures, who is discipled in the message of the Kingdom, is to bring out both old and new riches [Mat 13:52]. Apollos was a fulfillment of this word.
                    He was a scribe who began to teach the scriptures after receiving some discipleship. Such men are however not heralds but only speak based on the authority of the scriptures. Their authority is no greater than their knowledge of the scriptures
                    and accuracy of interpretation.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Lord has ordained that the preachers of the Gospel are to live off the Gospel [1Co 9:14].</li>
        <li>Preaching can simply be called speaking, especially when it is not to a very large crowd, where it is in a room.</li>
        <li>The message of a preacher/herald can in principle be anything. For example, the message Jesus commanded the healed demoniac was simply to tell people what the Lord had done for him [Mar 5:19-20].</li>
        <li>The message may be a warning, a good news, a doctrine. It may be delivered once. It may be delivered over a long period, even a lifetime and even generations.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Knowledge, indoctrination, training, discipline, character, disciple <em>(or discipleship)</em>, perfection<em> (i.e.., spiritual maturity) </em>are some key words and concepts associated with teaching</li>
        <li>Those who are taught are disciples <em>(of those who teach them)</em></li>
        <li>To teach<em> (under Christ)</em>is to impart knowledge and discipline according to the truth of God&rsquo;s Word.</li>
        <li>The goal of teaching is to bring the disciples to perfection in Christ [Col 1:28]</li>
        <li>The Scriptures&mdash;the writings of the prophets and apostles&mdash;are the teachers authoritative source of knowledge [2Ti 3:16-17; Rom 16:26].</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Teaching and Preaching</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Jesus taught in synagogues and heralded the Kingdom of God [Mat 9:35; 11:1]</li>
        <li>Preach <em>(&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;́&lambda;&lambda;&omega;, kataggellō)</em>, warn <em>(G3560, &nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&theta;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;́&omega;, noutheteō</em>), teach<em> (G1321, &delta;&iota;&delta;&alpha;́&sigma;&kappa;&omega;, didaskō</em>)
            in all wisdom so as to present every man perfect in Christ [Col 1:28]</li>
        <li>The message <em>(&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;́&lambda;&lambda;&omega;, kataggellō) </em>of resurrection through Jesus Christ was a teaching <em>(&Delta;&iota;&delta;&alpha;́&sigma;&kappa;&omega;, didaskō) </em>of the apostles
            [Act 4:2]</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The Authority Requirement</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Both preaching and teaching require authority.
            <ol>
                <li>We can see this in the demand to know the source of Jesus&rsquo; authority to teach the things he was teaching. He was either appointed by some established human authority or he was appointed by God&mdash;whoever appointed him, there must
                    be some proof. The Sanhedrin was instituted by Moses, therefore, they were confident in their own source of authority to interpret the Law.</li>
                <li>Those who teach under the Law of Moses&mdash;the Pharisees and teachers of the Law&mdash;are said by Christ to be seated in &ldquo;the Seat of Moses&rdquo; [Mat 23:2].</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>For this reason, since it is man that God ordained to the be head of the family and thus the community <em>(or assembly/church)</em>, women are not allowed to teach in the assembly. Since a teacher makes disciples of others and sets rules for living
            and such, it is out of place for a woman to teach for then she would be making men disciples.</li>
    </ol>
