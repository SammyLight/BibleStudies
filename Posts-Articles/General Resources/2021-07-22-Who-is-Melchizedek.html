<h1>Who is Melchizedek?</h1>
</header>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<blockquote>
  Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.<!--excerpt.end--> He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was. So Christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father." And he says in another place, "You are a priest forever, in the order of <strong>Melchizedek</strong>." During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him and was designated by God to be high priest in the <strong>order of Melchizedek</strong>. We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn.[Hebrews 5:1-11]
</blockquote>
<p>The writer of the book of Hebrews while explaining the High Priesthood of Jesus Christ said that Jesus is a Priest in the order of Melchizedek (Melchisedec). This person Melchizedek was previously spoken of and mentioned by name only in four verses in the 14th chapter of the book of Genesis and in one verse of the 110th chapter of the book of Psalms. There is not much that is said about this Melchizedek, yet the author of Hebrews said that there is much to say about Melchizedek and priesthood in the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>The objective of this article is to point out facts from scripture about Melchizedek, to clear misconceptions about who he is (and is not) and to explain what the order of Melchizedek means.</p>
<h1>Facts about Melchizedek</h1>
<p>Here are some Biblical facts about Melchizedek that can help shed light on his identity and what it means that Jesus is a High Priest in the Order of Melchizedek.</p>
<h2>Melchizedek Was a King</h2>
<blockquote>
  Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High.[Genesis 14:18]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,[Hebrews 7:1]
</blockquote>
<p>According to Moses, in the 14th chapter of the book of Genesis, Melchizedek was the king of Salem. The author of the epistle to the Hebrews echoed the same statement.</p>
<h2>Melchizedek is Human and Male</h2>
<blockquote>
  Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.[Hebrews 5:1]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. HE (MELCHIZEDEK) met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him.[Hebrews 7:1]
</blockquote>
<p>Melchizedek is a human being. The apostle teaches that every high priest is chosen from among MEN (human beings) not from among angels. Melchizedek is a human being, and he is also male. He is not a woman. The apostle says a priest is chosen from among MEN. The Greek word for Man as used in Hebrews 5:1 &ldquo;Anthropos&rdquo; and although the word can be used to refer to humanity (i.e., male and female), the context clearly implies that Melchizedek is masculine. Every priest in the Bible was a man so it would be out of place for Melchizedek to be a female priest. Also, the pronouns used to describe Melchizedek &ndash; although neuter in the Greek &ndash; were translated as male pronouns by the translators.</p>
<h2>Melchizedek is a Descendant of Adam and Noah</h2>
<p>We learn from Moses that before Adam, there was no man created [Genesis 2:4-5]. Luke quoted Paul saying that God created all nations from one man (obviously, Adam) [Acts 17:26]. This shows that there was no other man or no group of men before God created Adam. So, for Melchizedek to be a man [Hebrews 5:1], he must have descended fromAdam.</p>
<p>We also know that God destroyed all of humanity except for Noah and his sons and from them came all men [Genesis 9:18-19]. The obvious implication of this is that Melchizedek must be a descendant of Noah who was a descendant of Adam.</p>
<h2>He is a Priest of El Elyon (God Most High)</h2>
<p>The scriptures in [Genesis 14:8] and [Hebrews 7:1] both testify that Melchizedek was priest of God Most High</p>
<h2>He Received Tithes from Abraham</h2>
<blockquote>
  And blessed be God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand." Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.[Genesis 14:20]</blockquote>
<p>After Abraham (Abram at that time) returned from the slaughter of the kings, he gave a tenth of everything to Melchizedek.</p>
<h2>He Believes in God as the Creator of Heaven</h2>
<blockquote>
  Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram, saying, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heavenand earth.[Genesis 14:18-19]
</blockquote>
<p>Melchizedek referred to God as the creator of heaven and earth. This man &ndash; whoever he is &ndash; clearly knows God. Not only did he refer to God as El-Elyon (the Most High God), he also referred to Him as the creator of heaven and earth.</p>
<h2>He is Greater Than Abraham</h2>
<blockquote>
  Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder! &hellip; This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater.[Hebrews 7:4,6-7]
</blockquote>
<p>Melchizedek blessed Abram and according to scripture (and common sense) the one who gives the blessing is greater than the one who receives it.</p>
<h2>He Lived in the Land of Canaan</h2>
<blockquote>
  Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High. [Genesis 14:18]
</blockquote>
<p>Melchizedek was king of Salem where he obviously would have lived. The king of a kingdom does not live in another place. This Salem is the same place that came to be known as Jerusalem. Jerusalem was part of the land of the Canaan that Israel conquered.</p>
<h2>He Must Have Been Familiar with Abraham</h2>
<p>Melchizedek must have known Abraham before they met on that day for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>He called Abraham by name [Genesis 14:19]</li>
  <li>Abraham would not have given tithes to him if he did not know him as the priest of the Most High God [Genesis 14:20]</li>
  <li>Melchizedek referred to God as El-Elyon (God Most High) and the creator of heaven and earth [Genesis 14:19]; Abraham also referred to God as El-Elyon and the creator of heaven and earth. Melchizedek and Abraham used similar language to refer to God which suggests that Abraham may have learned some things about God from him.</li>
</ul>
<h2>He Was a Teacher of the Gospel</h2>
<blockquote>
  Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,[Genesis 14:18]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, and from his mouth men should seek instruction--because he is the messenger of the LORD Almighty.[Malachi 2:7]
</blockquote>
<p>Melchizedek was a priest of the Most High God and we know that a Priest is meant to preserve knowledge by teaching it to the people. Melchizedek&rsquo;s Job description included but was not limited to representing the people of Salem in matters relating to God, offering gifts, and making sacrifices for sins [Hebrews 5:1] and teaching the people the way of GOD [Malachi 2:7]</p>
<h2>Melchizedek Must Have Been Ordained as Priest by God Personally</h2>
<blockquote>Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward, he said, "Listen to my words: "When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams. But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?[Numbers 12:5-8]
</blockquote>
<p>Every High priest (and by extension every priest) is chosen by God [Hebrews 5:1] therefore, Melchizedek must have been chosen by God. Priests are either anointed by a prophet (like Moses anointed Aaron) or they are anointed by God directly to be priests (like Jesus). According to God prophets are distinct from prophets in hierarchy (as seen in Numbers 12 quoted above). Those He sees face to face are superior to those He shows visions. This means that Abraham who God appeared to face to face [Genesis 18, John 8:56] is a great prophet and superior to those who have not seen His face. The scriptures also tell us that Melchizedek is greater than Abraham [Hebrews 7:6-7]. If Abraham who is a less superior prophet to Melchizedek saw God face to face, it is correct to say that Melchizedek also saw God face to face and was most likely ordained to the priesthood by God Himself. If Melchizedek has not seen God face to face then according to the principle we see in Numbers 12, he cannot be greater than Abraham.</p>
<h2>Melchizedek is Not a High Priest</h2>
<p>There are only two priesthoods mentioned by name (order) in the Bible; the Levitical (Aaronic) priesthood and the Melchizedek priesthood (of which order Jesus Christ is the high priest). Melchizedek was never referred to as a high priest but as just a priest [Genesis 14:18, Hebrews 7:1]. There can only be one high priest at a time [Leviticus 16:32; 21:10, Numbers 35:25] so, if Jesus is a priest in the order of Melchizedek [Psalm 110:4, Hebrews 7:17] and Jesus is the High Priest of the priesthood [Hebrews 2:17; 3:1; 4:14; 6:20] then Melchizedek is not a High Priest.</p>
<h2>Melchizedek is Still Alive</h2>
<blockquote>
  The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.[Psalms 110:4]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him, and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means "king of righteousness"; then also, "king of Salem" means "king of peace." Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever. Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder! Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people - that is, their brothers - even though their brothers are descended from Abraham. This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater. In the one case, the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is <strong>declared to be living</strong>.[Hebrews 7:1-8]
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ESV,</em></strong> [Hebrews 7:8] &ldquo;<em>In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that <strong>he lives</strong>.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The scriptures say in the 110th chapter of Psalms, that Melchizedek is a priest forever and the author of the epistle to the Hebrews interprets it to mean that Melchizedek is alive; this is seen in the 8th verse of the 7th chapter when he said that Melchizedek is &ldquo;<strong>declared to be living</strong>&rdquo;. The scriptures also say that like the Son of Man (Jesus), Melchizedek <strong>remains (is still)</strong> a priest [Hebrews 7:3]. Melchizedek is still a priest of the Most High God till this very moment. A dead person cannot be a priest; so, if Melchizedek is still a priest, it must follow that he is still alive. According to scriptures, Melchizedek is still alive. Just like Enoch and Elijah, Melchizedek did not die but is still alive.</p>
<h1>Misconceptions about the Identity of Melchizedek</h1>
<p>It is wrongly said by some that Melchizedek is one of the following Biblical characters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jesus Christ</li>
  <li>An Angel</li>
  <li>Enoch</li>
  <li>Noah</li>
  <li>Shem</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are reasons why Melchizedek is most certainly none of the aforementioned.</p>
<h2>Melchizedek is Not Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Melchizedek is not Jesus for the following reasons:</p>
<h3>Jesus is High Priest while Melchizedek is just priest</h3>
<p>There are only two priesthoods mentioned in the Bible; the Levitical (Aaronic) priesthood and the Melchizedek priesthood (of which order Jesus Christ is the high priest). Melchizedek was never referred to as a high priest but as just a priest [Genesis 14:18, Hebrews 7:1]. There can only be one high priest at a time [Leviticus 16:32; 21:10, Numbers 35:25] so, if Jesus is a priest in the order of Melchizedek [Psalm 110:4, Hebrews 7:17] and Jesus is the High Priest of the priesthood [Hebrews 2:17; 3:1; 4:14; 6:20] then it means that Jesus Christ is not Melchizedek because He cannot be high priest and normal priest at the same time.</p>
<h3>The writer of Hebrews never said Melchizedek was Jesus</h3>
<p>It is also important to consider that if Jesus Christ was Melchizedek, the writer of Hebrews may have pointed it out.</p>
<h3>Neither Abraham nor Moses mentioned that Melchizedek was Jesus</h3>
<p>Abraham met Melchizedek [Genesis 14] and met Jesus Christ [Genesis 18, John 8:56] and neither Abraham who met both men nor Moses who gave us the account in Genesis hinted at the fact that they were the same person.</p>
<h3>Jesus did not live on earth like Melchizedek</h3>
<p>Scriptures teach that Jesus &ndash; apart from his thirty-three and a half years on earth &ndash; lived and still lives (until the establishment of His kingdom on earth in the age to come) in heaven [Psalms 110]. Scriptures also teach that Jesus returned to heaven after His meetings with Abraham [Genesis 17:22; 18:33] whereas we know that Melchizedek was king of Salem and as earlier established, he would have lived in the city he was king and priest.</p>
<h3>Abraham treated Jesus with greater reverence than he did Melchizedek</h3>
<p>Abraham treated Jesus with far more reverence than he did Melchizedek [Genesis 14 &amp; 18]; why would he treat him differently at different times considering that Abraham knew He was God?</p>
<h3>Melchizedek &ndash; unlike Jesus Christ - has no genealogical record</h3>
<p>Jesus&rsquo; genealogy is available to us in scripture and the same also say that Melchizedek is without genealogy therefore Melchizedek cannot be Jesus.</p>
<p>Melchizedek is not Jesus.</p>
<h2>Melchizedek is Not an Angel</h2>
<p>The Bible teaches that priests are chosen from among men to represent them in matters relating to God [Hebrews 5:1, Hebrews 2:17]. Seeing as Melchizedek was king and priest of Salem (a human community), he could not have been an angel. An angel cannot be priest over men. Even Jesus had to become a man in order for Him to be our High Priest [Hebrews 2:17]</p>
<h2>Melchizedek is Not Enoch</h2>
<p>Scriptures say that Melchizedek is without genealogy [Hebrews 7:3] and Enoch&rsquo;s genealogy is present in scripture [Genesis 5:18-24]; therefore, Melchizedek cannot be Enoch.</p>
<h2>Melchizedek is Not Noah nor is He Shem</h2>
<p>Scriptures say that Melchizedek is without genealogy [Hebrews 7:3]. Scriptures present us with the genealogies of Noah and his son Shem. Both Noah and Shem were recorded to have been born and died [Genesis 5:28,32; 9:28-29; 11:11]; the same cannot be said of Melchizedek who is declared to still be alive [Hebrews 7:8]; therefore, Melchizedek can neither be said to be Noah nor can he be said to be Shem</p>
<h1>What the Order of Melchizedek Means</h1>
<blockquote>
  And he says in another place, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."[Hebrews 5:6]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever.[Hebrews 7:3]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life. For it is declared: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.[Hebrews 7:15-17]
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.[Hebrews 7:24]
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;&hellip;like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>The writer of Hebrews interprets the promise to Christ that He is a priest <strong>FOREVER</strong>, in the <strong>ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK</strong> to mean that Melchizedek is a priest forever, in other words, the &ldquo;<strong>FOREVER</strong>&rdquo; in the promise is a characteristic of the Melchizedek order of priesthood. The fact that it is forever is what makes it superior to the Levitical priesthood where the priests would die and need to be replaced [Hebrews 7:23]. The permanency (never ending nature) of the Melchizedek priesthood is one of its defining features and what makes it superior and different to the Levitical priesthood.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s promise to Jesus in Psalm 110 can be correctly restated thus:</p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;you are a priest forever just like Melchizedek is a priest forever&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The order of Melchizedek means that the priesthood is endless. It means that those in that priesthood &ndash; like Jesus and Melchizedek &ndash; will be priests of the most high god forever. Hallelujah.</strong></p>
<h1>More Misunderstandings about Melchizedek</h1>
<p>As earlier stated, there are many misunderstandings about the identity of Melchizedek. Here are some other facts about Melchizedek that are misunderstood.</p>
<h2>Without Father or Mother</h2>
<p>It is believed that Melchizedek had no parents because of the statement that he is without father or mother [Hebrews 7:3]. This belief is not consistent with scripture and is clearly misunderstood. It has already been established in an earlier portion of this article that Melchizedek is a human being. Since he is a human being who descended from Adam and Noah then he must have had earthly parents. Every man except Adam was born of earthly parents. When the Bible says without father or mother, it refers to the absence of his genealogical records. The implication of him not having parents is that he is another Adam. It means that God created another man apart from Adam and this is not consistent with scripture [Genesis 2:4-5; 9:18-19 &amp; Acts 17:26], because as stated earlier there was no other man God created apart from Adam. To insist that he did not have parents could also imply that he was an angel and it is already clear that Melchizedek is not an angel. Also, it is known that God is against angels who leave their positions and live among men [Jude 1:6]. Clearly Melchizedek was a man born of earthly parents.</p>
<h2>Without Beginning of Days</h2>
<p>It has already been established that Melchizedek had earthly parents. This means that he had a beginning. So obviously, again, when the scriptures say he is without beginning of days, [Hebrews 7:3] it is also referring to the absence of his genealogy. There is no record of his beginning therefore the writer of the book of Hebrews says &ldquo;&hellip;without beginning of days&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<h2>Without End of Life</h2>
<p>Unlike the other statements in [Hebrews 7:3], the end of life does not refer exclusively to the absence of his genealogy. As has already been established, Melchizedek is still alive to this day. This does not however mean that Melchizedek is alive somewhere in the world today. Since Jesus was and still is the only one (until the first resurrection) to receive eternal life [Isaiah 66:7-11, Micah 2:13, Acts 26:23, Romans 8:29, Colossians 1:18, Hebrews 11:39-40]. God must have caught him up to heaven like He did Enoch, Moses and Elijah. That is the only way Melchizedek can still be alive to this day.</p>
<h1>Similarities between Jesus Christ and Melchizedek</h1>
<ul>
  <li>They are both kings</li>
  <li>They are both kings of the same city</li>
  <li>They are both priests</li>
  <li>Their priesthood is of the same order</li>
  <li>They are both alive; although Melchizedek does not yet have eternal life but is preserved from decay by being in heaven like Enoch, Moses and Elijah.</li>
	<li>They both used bread and wine</li>
</ul>
<h1>Additional Facts from the Melchizedek Story</h1>
<h2>Jerusalem Has Always Been on God&rsquo;s Mind</h2>
<p>The fact that a man as great (more so than Abraham) as Melchizedek lived and was king and priest over the same land that God would eventually choose to bear His name for all eternity implies that David&rsquo;s choice of Jerusalem as the chief city in Israel was not arbitrary. Melchizedek could have been king and priest of any other city in Canaan or its surroundings and David could have chosen any other city in Israel to be the capital city where God would place His name, but God orchestrated it such that it is the same city. It is no mere coincidence.</p>
<h2>The Canaanites Must Have Known About God</h2>
<blockquote>
  After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley). Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High.[Genesis 14:17-18]
</blockquote>
<p>Melchizedek was king and priest of Salem in Canaan. If so great a priest of God Most High as Melchizedek lived in Canaan, then it would be impossible for the people around not to have an idea of who God was. Especially considering the fact that he was a teacher of the gospel</p>
<p>Melchizedek was present when Abraham and the king of Sodom were discussing. It implies that the king of Sodom (a region near Salem in Canaan) was also familiar with Melchizedek. It seems implausible that they would not know about the God of a king as great as Melchizedek.</p>
<p>The fact that Abraham also swore to God in the presence of the king of Sodom subtly suggests that perhaps, the king of Sodom may have known of the God Abraham was swearing by. This is not to say that the king of Sodom and all the Canaanites worshiped El-Elyon. The point is that they would have known something about Him the way Christians today know of other religions.</p>
<h1>Why This Article is Significant</h1>
<p>As the writer of Hebrews wrote, there was and probably still is more to be said about Melchizedek [Hebrews 5:11] but he could not because of the dullness of some of his readers. The writer of Hebrews considered it dullness to not know about Melchizedek (and by extension, other things in scripture). By the grace of God, this article has been able to present &ndash; from the little information given &ndash; many truths about this man Melchizedek. If proper attention is paid to the scriptures, just like in the case of this article, there is much that can be learned about God and this is His will for us that we grow in His word [Ephesians 4:11-16; Hebrews 5:11-14; 1Peter 2:2].</p>
<p>This article proves right the writer of the book of Hebrews when he writes that there is more to be said about Melchizedek. Only from a handful of verses, a wealth of knowledge emerged. It is absolutely necessary that we give proper attention to God&rsquo;s word and grow. May God bless us as we seek to know Him more.</p>
