<!--excerpt.start--><p>The “<strong>sure mercies of David</strong>” is how God described the promise and covenant that he made with King David. We find this definition in his words through the prophet Isaiah [Isa 55:3 KJV]. <em> The phrase is translated differently in different translations.</em></p><p>God originally gave this promise and covenant to David through the prophet Nathan after David expressed his desire to build a temple for Yahweh [2Sam 7:8-17; 2Sam 23:5-7].</p><p>One of the most significant things about this covenant, “<strong>the sure mercies of David</strong>”, is that though it was originally primarily for David and his house, God promised that he will make this covenant with all who repent of their sins and turn to him.</p><!--excerpt.end-->

<h1>Characteristics of &ldquo;the Sure Mercies of David&rdquo;</h1>
<h2>Promise vs., Covenant</h2>
<p>What we read in 2Sam 7:8-17 is a promise <em>(promises)</em>. It is, however, also called a &ldquo;covenant&rdquo; by God [Psa 89:28]. It is called a covenant because it has the essential characteristic of a covenant&mdash;it is everlasting.</p>
<h2>What God Promised David</h2>
<p>The promise is ultimately that David&rsquo;s house and kingdom and Throne will endure and be established forever before God [2Sam 7:16].</p>
<p>The promise concerns David, Israel, David&rsquo;s family and David&rsquo;s chosen son in particular.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Concerning David. </strong> Apart from what has already been stated above,
<ol>
<li>God will make David&rsquo;s name as great as the greatest men of the earth [2Sam 7:9]</li>
<li>God will give David rest from all his enemies [2Sam 7:11]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Concerning Israel </strong>
<ol>
<li>God will settle Israel in their land and give them rest from all their enemies [2Sam 7:10-11]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Concerning David&rsquo;s Chosen Son</strong>
<ol>
<li>This David&rsquo;s Son after him will build the Temple of God which David had desired to build and which was the occasion for this promise of God [2Sam 7:12-13 <em>cf., </em>2Sam 7:1-2]</li>
<li><em>The promise speaks of a son coming from the body of David (not adopted) who will be king after David [2Sam 7:12]</em></li>
<li>God promised to establish his kingdom over Israel forever [2Sam 7:13]</li>
<li>God promised that he would be Father to David&rsquo;s son and he will be Son to God [2Sam 7:14]</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">God promised never to take away his &ldquo;love&rdquo; <em>(called &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; in the KJV)</em> from David&rsquo;s Son even if he sins against God [2Sam 7:15].</span></strong>
<ol>
<li>Kings are sons to God, members of his family. To take His love away from a king would be to reject him as king. This is what happened to king Saul&mdash;God took away his love from Saul because of his sins.</li>
<li>The Son of David that God particularly had in mind was Solomon whom God chose to be king after David [1Chr 28:6].</li>
<li><strong>Though <strong>this promise </strong>specific to Solomon, yet it applies not only to Solomon but to all David&rsquo;s sons [Psa 89:30-33].</strong></li>
<li>If David&rsquo;s son sins, God will punish him but God will not reject him as he rejected Saul.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>&ldquo;Sureness&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s Love&mdash;the Sureness of the Covenant</h2>
<p>Why does God call this covenant <strong>&ldquo;sure&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p>God calls the promise / covenant <strong>&ldquo;sure&rdquo;</strong> because God has ensured that there is nothing that any of David&rsquo;s children can do or fail to do that will cause David&rsquo;s Throne to cease or his lineage to come to an end.</p>
<ol>
<li>The covenant unconditionally provides security for David&rsquo;s Throne and lineage</li>
<li>According to Isaiah, however, the covenant provides security for David&rsquo;s sons on the condition that they repent of their sins and turn to God [Isa 55:1-13].</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that the covenant does not secure the individual members of David&rsquo;s family no matter what but requires them to be committed to God.</p>
<h1>The &ldquo;Sure Mercies of David&rdquo; and Isaiah 55</h1>
<p>God, through the prophet Isaiah, calls to his people to repent of their evil ways and to turn to him and give attention to his words [Isa 55:3,7]. And he promises those who repent and turn to him that he would make &ldquo;an everlasting covenant&rdquo; with them and that this everlasting covenant will be the &ldquo;sure mercies of David&rdquo; [KJV] or &ldquo;the faithful love promised to David&rdquo; [NIV] [Isa 55:3].</p>
<p>Through Jesus Christ, this invitation is extended to all men and not just Israelites because through Jesus Christ, we become God&rsquo;s people too [Gal 3:28; Rom 9:24-26<em>ff</em>].</p>
<p>The following are some important facts about the &ldquo;sure mercies of David&rdquo; or the &ldquo;steadfast, sure love for David&rdquo; [ESV] in Isa 55,</p>
<ol>
<li>It is an everlasting covenant for those who repent of their evil ways and turn to God [Isa 55:3,7].</li>
<li>They will have eternal life [Isa 55:3],</li>
<li>Their sins will be forgiven [Isa 55:7]</li>
<li>He promises them
<ol>
<li>Peace and security [Isa 55:12] <em>(which is part of the original promise to David)</em></li>
<li>The curse on the earth will be reversed for them [Isa 55:12-13 <em>cf., </em> Gen 3:17-19; Rom 5:12; 8:20-21]</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Great Things Tied To and Promised in the &ldquo;Sure Mercies of David&rdquo;</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>The forgiveness of sins</strong> for those who repent of their sins and give attention to God&rsquo;s word. This is a most prominent feature of the this covenant. To be brought into the sure mercies of David is to be guaranteed forgiveness of sins.
<ol>
<li>However, it is important to note that the covenant demands repentance and giving attention to God and also</li>
<li>The covenant does not mean that God will ignore sin completely. Rather, though God will forgive his erring sons, he will, nevertheless, punish them [2Sam 7:14; Psa 89:30-33].</li>
<li>Let us emphasize that the forgiveness of sins is not absolutely unconditional. They must remain in the state of repentance and turning to God.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Adoption as sons of God [2Sam 7:14]</strong>. The covenant is a covenant that makes David&rsquo;s children God&rsquo;s children and God their Father. Therefore, by making the &ldquo;sure mercies of David&rdquo; an everlasting covenant for all who turn to God, it means that God is giving adoption as sons of God to them. God will recognize the repentant and devout as sons of David.</li>
<li><strong>Salvation [2Sam 23:5].</strong> David spoke of God&rsquo;s sure promise of love as guaranteeing his salvation, i.e., his resurrection from the dead [2Sam 23:5].</li>
<li><strong>The Kingdom of God&mdash;&ldquo;Rising sun&rdquo;</strong> [2Sam 23:4]. The &ldquo;rising of the sun&rdquo; is a spiritual way of describing the coming of <em>(Yahweh in the person of) </em>the Lord Jesus [2Sam 23:4]. The rising of the sun speaks of
<ol>
<li>A new day, a new age</li>
<li>Healing&mdash;the resurrection of dead [Mal 4:2]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Resurrection</strong>&mdash;&ldquo;bringing of grass from the earth&rdquo; speaks of resurrection [2Sam 23:4]</li>
<li><strong>Eternal life</strong> [Isa 55:3]</li>
<li><strong>Renewal of the earth </strong>[Isa 55:12-13 <em>cf., </em> Gen 3:17-19; Rom 5:12; 8:20-21]</li>
</ol>
<h1>The &ldquo;Sure Mercies of David&rdquo; and Some Other Major Covenants</h1>
<p>God never does anything in isolation from other things he has done and is doing. Therefore, it is useful, in understanding the grand scheme of things, to understand the &ldquo;Sure mercies of <em>(or love promised) </em>David&rdquo; in view of previous decrees, promises, covenants and prophecies of God.</p>
<p>We will consider just a few of those.</p>
<h2>With Regard to the Abrahamic Covenant</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s covenant with Abraham had two major promises,</p>
<ol>
<li>It promised Abraham and his children adoption as God&rsquo;s children&mdash;God will be their God and they would be his people.</li>
<li>It also promised that the land of Canaan to Abraham and his <em>(bodily)</em> descendants.</li>
</ol>
<p>What we can clearly see is that the everlasting covenant of the &ldquo;sure mercies of David&rdquo; makes these very same promises</p>
<ol>
<li>It promises adoption as sons and</li>
<li>It promises the people of Israel, Abraham&rsquo;s chosen descendants, rest&mdash;a secure dwelling place.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, we can see that the sure mercies of David is a fulfilment of the Abrahamic covenant.</p>
<h2>With Regard to the Old Covenant&mdash;The Law of Moses</h2>
<p>The Old Covenant, i.e., the Law of Moses, was a covenant made in fulfilment of God&rsquo;s covenant with Abraham. The covenant was made so that the people of Israel may be God&rsquo;s people and that God may be their God.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is clearly similar to the sure mercies of David.</p>
<p>The major difference, however, between the Law of Moses and the sure mercies of David is the matter of forgiveness of sins. One deals effectively with sin while the other doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>While the Law of Moses made provisions for forgiveness of sins, they were not effective. The sure mercies of David, however, promises a more effective solution to sin.</p>
<p>Under the Law of Moses, the people provided their ineffective atonements for sin. However, under the sure mercies of David, God does not require any sacrifice from the people but promises to forgive them. The implication is that God will provide whatever is necessary to forgive the people their sins. All that is required of them is that they repent of their sins and turn to God.</p>
<ol>
<li>Both offer adoption as sons <em>(God&rsquo;s people) </em>[Exo 6:7; 29:45-46]</li>
<li>Both recognize the need for forgiveness of sins but have different approaches to dealing with it</li>
<li>Both are concerned with the dwelling of God among his people [Exo 29:45-46]</li>
<li>Both seek the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s covenant and promises to Abraham</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, since they both, more or less, serve the very same purpose, one is bound to replace the other.</p>
<h2>With Regard to the New Covenant</h2>
<p>The New Covenant is a replacement of the Old Covenant and is also a fulfilment of the Abrahamic Covenant [Heb 8:8-13].</p>
<p>Since the New Covenant is a replacement of the Old Covenant, it is very much similar to the Sure mercies of David. In the end, however, they are not just similar, but are actually the same. The Sure mercies of David, is another name for the New Covenant.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Forgiveness of sins</strong>: Both covenants effectively deal with sin. Originally, when God first declared sure mercies for David, he only stated that he would forgive David&rsquo;s sons. He, however, did not state how. In Isaiah, where he announces the Sure Mercies of David as an everlasting covenant, he declared what the atonement would be. We find this in Isaiah 53 [Isa 53:1-12]. The atonement in Isaiah 53 is the same atonement as the atonement of the New Covenant&mdash;the Messiah, Jesus. <strong><span style="color: #993300;">This is sufficient to show that the two covenants are the same</span>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Everlastingness of the Covenants</strong>: Both covenants are everlasting and will never pass away.</li>
<li><strong>Adoption as sons of God</strong>: Both covenants ensure adoption as sons of God [Jer 32:38]</li>
<li><strong>Connection to David&rsquo;s House and Throne</strong>: Both covenants are tied to the house of David&mdash;Jesus of the New Covenant is the Son of David and the heir to David&rsquo;s Throne [Luk 1:32].</li>
<li><strong>The Kingdom of God and Israel</strong>: Both covenants promise and guarantee the Kingdom of God.</li>
<li><strong>Building of God&rsquo;s House</strong>: Both covenants guarantee a house of God. The building of the Temple, a house for God was only partially fulfilled in Solomon. The ultimate fulfilment is in Christ.</li>
<li>We can go on&hellip;</li>
</ol>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, the &ldquo;Sure Mercies of David&rdquo; is another name for the New Covenant. It is a promise and covenant of adoption as sons into God&rsquo;s family and is only for those who repent of their sins and turn to God and give attention to him.</p>
<p>The covenant is sure because it effectively takes care of sins so that God&rsquo;s sons through this covenant are not rejected. We must emphasize, however, that this security is only for those who are under the covenant and who maintain their repentance from sin and their devotion to God.</p>
<p>All those who are under the covenant are automatically adopted, not only into God&rsquo;s family, but also into David&rsquo;s family and are royalty. They will have rule of the earth in the New Age of the Kingdom of God.</p>
