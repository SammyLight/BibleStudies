<h1>Relationship of Glory, Honor and Immortality/Incorruption</h1>
<ol>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li><strong>Glory and Honor</strong>: Glory brings honor; glory is honor [Psa 8:5; 145:5; 1Co 15:43 <em>the opposite of dishonor is glory</em>; Rom 9:21-23 <em>the vessels of honor are the objects of glory</em>; Heb 3:3 <em>glory is honor&mdash;the more the glory the greater the honor</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li><strong>Glory and Immortality/Incorruption <em>(ἀ&phi;&theta;&alpha;&rho;&sigma;ί&alpha; (aftharsia) 'incorruptibility'&mdash;G0861)</em></strong>: The opposite of corruption <em>(&phi;&theta;&omicron;&rho;&alpha;́, phthora&mdash;Gx5356)</em>[1Co 15:42-44]</li>
</ol>
<h1>Glory is the Goal of Righteousness <em>By Faith</em></h1>
<p>Clearly, &ldquo;glory, honor and immortality&rdquo; [Rom 2:7; 3:23-24] is the goal of righteousness.</p>
<ol> 
    <ol>
        <li>First, because these are attained by patient continuance in doing good [Rom 2:7] which really is patient continuance in being righteous. To be righteous is to be good, it is to do good.</li>
        <li>Second, because it is glory that he say we all fell short of by sin and then says we are justified by grace [Rom 3:23-24].</li>
        <li>Thirdly, immediately after proving that the doctrine of righteousness by faith apart from the Law and circumcision is not against the Law [Rom 4], what he turns to next is glory. In Rom 5 the ultimate result of our righteousness by faith is glory&mdash;we
            rejoice in the hope of the glory of God [Rom 5:2] <em>and this hope of glory is the result of God&rsquo;s grace</em>. This hope of glory is still the goal of the building of our character through suffering and the gift of God&rsquo;s Spirit
            to us [Rom 5:3-5]. <em>The Holy Spirit is clearly connected to our glorification, in this letter [Rom 8:11] and elsewhere [2Co 3:8,18; Phi 3:21; 1Pe 4:14]</em></li>
        <li>Fourthly, reading on in the letter, we still find glory to be the goal on Paul&rsquo;s mind
            <ol>
                <li>The goal of suffering with him is that we may be glorified with him [Rom 8:17]</li>
                <li>It is for the sake of the glory that will be revealed in us that we endure all things, because nothing is comparable to it [Rom 8:18]</li>
                <li>From foreknowledge, to predestination, to calling, to justification and to the end, glorification [Rom 8:30]</li>
                <li>Israel&rsquo;s heritage&mdash;the adoption of sons and glory [Rom 9:4]</li>
                <li>God has endured the vessels of wrath in order that he might make known <em>the riches of </em>His glory to the vessels of His mercy [Rom 9:22-23]</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Fifthly, the value of glory
            <ol>
                <li>It is by glory that our Lord Jesus was delivered from death [Rom 6:4]. Therefore, our deliverance from death is ultimately by God&rsquo;s glory.</li>
                <li>Our salvation, our freedom from corruption is by God&rsquo;s glory [Rom 8:21-23]. <em>At the start of the letter, Paul had mentioned salvation in connection with righteousness by faith such that salvation is the value of righteousness [Rom 1:16-17]</em>.</li>
                <li>The receiving of eternal life depends on God&rsquo;s glory [Rom 6:4]. Apparently, since we cannot live if we are in bondage to death and since deliverance from death depends on God&rsquo;s glory, then life eternal depends on us being glorified.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>Therefore, indeed, the <strong>goal</strong>, what one hopes to gain, the <strong>reward </strong>of righteousness is <strong>glory </strong><em>(and honor and immortality and eternal life)</em>.</li>
