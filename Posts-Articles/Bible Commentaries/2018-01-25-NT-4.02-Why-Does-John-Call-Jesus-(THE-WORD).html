<header><h1>Why Does John Call Jesus (THE WORD)?</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start--><p>Is Jesus the word&nbsp;<em>(or words)</em>&nbsp;God spoke in the beginning, recorded in Genesis 1, that brought about creation?</p>
<p>To answer this question, please consider the following verses carefully, paying attention to &ldquo;the word&rdquo; and &ldquo;life&rdquo;.</p><!--excerpt.end-->
<blockquote>In the beginning was&nbsp;<strong>the Word</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>the Word</strong>&nbsp;was with God, and&nbsp;<strong>the Word</strong>&nbsp;was God.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>He was with God in the beginning.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>Through him all things were
    made; without him nothing was made that has been made.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup><strong>In him was life</strong>, and that life was the light of men. [Joh 1:1-3]</blockquote>
<blockquote>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched&mdash;this we proclaim concerning&nbsp;<strong>the Word of life</strong>.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup><strong>The life&nbsp;</strong>appeared;
    we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. [1Jo 1:1-2]</blockquote>
<p>Take note from the above that</p>
<ol>
    <li>In Joh 1:1, John simply calls Jesus &ldquo;the Word&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>In 1Jo 1:1, John calls him &ldquo;the Word of Life&rdquo; and,</li>
    <li>In the verse that follows [1Jo 1:2], he simply calls him &ldquo;the Life&rdquo; omitting &ldquo;Word of&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can see that John calls Jesus &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; in connection to&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;eternal</em>&nbsp;life&rdquo;. And if you are wondering why he does this, it is because it is through the words of Jesus that we have eternal life.</p>
<blockquote>I tell you the truth,&nbsp;<strong>whoever hears my word and believes</strong>&nbsp;him who sent me&nbsp;<strong>has eternal life</strong>&nbsp;and will not be condemned;&nbsp;<strong>he has crossed over from death to life</strong>. [Joh 5:24]</blockquote>
<blockquote>Simon Peter answered him, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go?&nbsp;<strong>You have the words of eternal life</strong>.&nbsp;<sup>69</sup>We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.&rdquo; [Joh 6:68-69]</blockquote>
<blockquote>I tell you the truth,&nbsp;<strong>if anyone keeps my word</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>he will never see death</strong>.&rdquo; [Joh 8:51]</blockquote>
<p>This is personification, representing an abstract quality or idea as a person or creature. This practice of personification is consistent in John and, in fact, throughout scriptures.</p>
<h1>Jesusâ€™ other Titles in John</h1>
<p>Below are just a few examples of other titles that John calls Jesus by that are personifications.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>THE RESURRECTION&nbsp;</strong>[Joh 11:25].</li>
<p>Jesus is certainly not a phenomenon nor an event but a person, therefore, calling him the resurrection does not mean that he is the event yet to happen, called the resurrection. Rather, the reason Jesus is called the resurrection is because it is by him
    and through him that the resurrection will happen.</p>
<li><strong>THE LIFE&nbsp;</strong>[Joh 11:25; 1JO 1:2].</li>
<p>Jesus is called the life because it is through him that we have eternal life. Jesus is the only hope anyone has for eternal life, apart from him, it is impossible [Joh 1:4].</p>
<li><strong>THE WAY&nbsp;</strong>[Joh 14:6].&nbsp;</li>
<p>Jesus is called the way because it is through him, by faith in him and association with him, that we will be given access to heaven. It is through Jesus Christ that we become citizens of heaven and the New Jerusalem and will be given full, unhindered,
    access into these places [Joh 14:2-4].</p>
<li><strong>THE LIGHT&nbsp;</strong>[Joh 1:8-9; 8:12].</li>
<p>Light is a spiritual word for &ldquo;life&rdquo;, i.e., in scriptures, life is sometimes figuratively called<em>&nbsp;</em>or described as light [Joh 8:12&nbsp;<em>light of life</em>]. Therefore, because Jesus is the source, the only source and hope of
    eternal life, he is called &ldquo;the light&rdquo;.</p>
</ol>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>There are other titles such as, &ldquo;<strong>the door</strong>&rdquo;, by which John and other scriptures call Jesus, however, I believe that these are enough to demonstrate why John called Jesus &ldquo;the Word&rdquo;. It is all about the relationship
    of the Gospel, the word, the message of Jesus Christ and eternal life.</p>
<blockquote>&hellip;our Savior, Christ Jesus &hellip;has destroyed death and&nbsp;<strong>has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel</strong>. [2Ti 1:10]</blockquote>
<p>If we know that even before his humanity, from before creation, Jesus had always been an actual person, we know that Jesus is certainly not the word or words God spoke in the beginning by which he brought about creation.</p>
