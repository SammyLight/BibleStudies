    <h1>Faith Simplified</h1>
</header>
<ol>
    <li>To have faith is to believe.</li>
    <li>One&rsquo;s faith is differentiated from another primarily by what or who is believed in</li>
    <li>At the root of all faith is knowledge&mdash;whether it is true or not, completely or partially,</li>
    <li>A person&rsquo;s or people&rsquo;s faith can have different degrees of strength or weakness.
        <ol>
            <li>A strong faith is one that cannot be easily dissolved or weakened.</li>
            <li>How strong or weak a faith is determined or tested by arguments against it. These arguments may simply
                be
                events or actual arguments against what one believes.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The strength of one&rsquo;s faith is dependent on
        <ol>
            <li>One&rsquo;s knowledge,</li>
            <li>How rooted and sound one&rsquo;s knowledge is regarding what one believes. This is really affected by
                <strong>familiarity</strong> which is affected by
                <ol>
                    <li>One relating with that knowledge over and over again. This can be accomplished through
                        words&mdash;hearing or reading or learning it over and over again, or by</li>
                    <li>Experience&mdash;the more one experiences a thing, the more one believes in it to the point of
                        taking for it granted.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>One&rsquo;s nature/character
                <ol>
                    <li>Some people are inclined to questioning everything and always have doubts and suspicions, while
                        some
                        people are not. This may be generally or particular to certain things true. For example, some
                        people
                        have the unreasonable fear of drowning,
                        and so, even when at a distance from a body of water that poses no immediate or real threat to
                        them,
                        they are overwhelmed with fear.</li>
                    <li>There is no amount of knowledge that will change the way a dog sees certain things. In fact we
                        can
                        be sure that there are things, though true, that a dog will never understand because it does not
                        have the nature or capacity to.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    <li>What makes faith so important is that it is the summary, the mixture of what one really knows or considers to be
        true and one&rsquo;s character/nature. Therefore, if the faith of a man is known, his future actions in
        different circumstances can
        be accurately predicted. Faith is of the heart, it has to do with knowledge and with natural
        inclinations/character, and since the heart is the fountain of the issues of life, then one&rsquo;s faith really
        determines one&rsquo;s life. Faith
        affects everything we knowingly do.</li>
    </li>
