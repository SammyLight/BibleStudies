<ol>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>God spoke through prophets and angels in the past [<em>Heb 1:1</em>]</li>
    <li>He spoke through His Son in the latter times [<em>Heb 1:2</em>]</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>The message spoken by prophets, angels and the Son is salvation [<em>Heb 1:1-2; 2:2-3</em>]</li>
    <li>The salvation is through Jesus Himself [<em>Heb 2:10</em>]</li>
    <li>The message carries a heavy warning, because it is from the Son [<em>Heb 2:1-3</em>]</li>
    <li>The message is a command, and not a suggestion [<em>Act 17:30-31</em>]</li>
    <li>This present age is subject to angels [<em>Heb 2:5</em>]</li>
    <li>The age to come is subjected to man (i.e., glorified sons of God) [<em>Heb 2:5</em>].</li>
    <li>Man is not yet mature enough (i.e., not yet glorified) for the earth to be handed over to him [<em>Heb 2:6-8</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus is the head of this new glorified man [<em>Heb 2:9</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus however has been glorified [<em>Heb 2:9</em>].</li>
    <li>God wants to bring many sons to glory, but the author of the epistle takes for granted that his audience might not know what he means. He didn&rsquo;t bother explaining it [<em>Heb 2:10</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus is the author of our salvation [<em>Heb 2:9-10</em>].</li>
    <li>The goal of salvation is perfection [<em>Heb 2:10</em>].</li>
    <li>Perfection is to be complete.</li>
    <li>The message is Jesus bringing many sons to glory [<em>Heb 2:10</em>].</li>
    <li>The author again takes for granted that the devil has the power of death, and that Jesus is to destroy the devil. He doesn&rsquo;t expatiate [<em>Heb 2:14</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus helps Abraham&rsquo;s descendants</li>
    <li>Not just Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, but men since the foundation of the world [<em>Heb 9:25-26</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus appeared at the end of the world [<em>Heb 9:26</em>] (Bonus point).</li>
    <li>The second death is for men and angels [<em>Rev 20:10</em>], but the author says Jesus&rsquo; death is only for flesh and blood; not for angels [<em>Heb 2:14-16</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus had to become a man, so that he could be a merciful and faithful High Priest. And make atonement for the sins of the people [<em>Heb 2:17</em>]. To make sure Jesus is merciful and faithful, He had to become flesh and blood. This is the message
        of the book of Hebrews.</li>
    <li>In order to partake of the glory that Jesus brings, we have to hold on to Jesus [<em>Heb 3:6</em>].</li>
    <li>The word of God is discerns/judges sins, the word of God is going to expose sin [<em>Heb 4:12-13</em>].</li>
    <li>Chapter 2 presented Jesus&rsquo; high priesthood and atonement, in Chapter 4, the author begins to focus on the high priesthood of Jesus, and will deal with the atonement later</li>
    <li>The mercy of Jesus&rsquo; priesthood has to do with His ability to sympathize with our weakness [<em>Heb 4:15</em>].</li>
    <li>God is the one who said Christ is His Son, and in doing so, makes Him [<em>the High</em>] Priest [<em>Heb 5:1-6</em>].</li>
    <li>Perfection is for those who <strong>OBEY</strong> Jesus [<em>Heb 5:9</em>].</li>
    <li>The summary is that Jesus was appointed by God. He didn&rsquo;t make Himself High Priest.</li>
    <li>The two immutable/unchangeable things of Hebrews 6:18 are the oath to bless Abraham with many descendants, and the oath to Jesus that He would be a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.</li>
    <li>Drawing near to God is a goal of God for us [<em>Heb 7:19</em>], but again, the author says it in passing; like it&rsquo;s something with which his audience is familiar.</li>
    <li>The main activity of Jesus as our high priest is intercession [<em>Heb 7:25</em>].</li>
    <li>God does not need the Law to condemn sinners (<em>see Job, and other sins before the Law</em>).</li>
