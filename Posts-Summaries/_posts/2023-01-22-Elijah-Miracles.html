<header><h1>Elijah's Miracles</h1></header>
<ol>
    <li>Elijah caused the rain to cease and remain so until he says otherwise [<em>1Kgs 17:1</em>].</li>
    <li>He was fed bread and meat by ravens (an unclean bread), and he drank from a brook [<em>1Kgs 17:4</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>God can combine a miracle with something natural.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God sent him to a Gentile woman (not a Jew) to fed him [<em>1Kgs 17:9-16</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>This means God must have showed Elijah the woman, because he did not just go to any random woman to ask for food.</li>
            <li>God also orchestrated things in a way that he met the woman while she was gathering wood. She was waiting for him but did not even know.</li>
            <li>The woman must have recognized Elijah as a prophet because she said: &ldquo;as the Lord <strong>THY </strong>God liveth&rdquo;, not &ldquo;as the Lord <strong>MY </strong>God liveth&rdquo; [<em>1Kgs 17:12</em>].</li>
            <li>The goal of the miracle was to feed Elijah and not for the woman and her son to eat. God was blessing Elijah and the woman was a beneficiary.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Elijah brought the son of the woman back to life [<em>1Kgs 17:17-24</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Though a Gentile, the woman showed from the way she talked, that she was acquainted with and was a worshipper of the God of Israel.</li>
            <li>Elijah stretched himself over the child 3 times and prayed to Yahweh and the boy&rsquo;s soul returned to him [<em>1Kgs 17:21-22</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Elijah challenged and defeated the prophets of Baal by calling down fire from heaven when they could not [<em>1Kgs 18:1-40</em>].</li>
    <li>Elijah brought back the rain [<em>1Kgs 18:1,41-45</em>].</li>
    <li>Elijah outran Ahab&rsquo;s chariot [<em>1Kgs 18:46</em>].</li>
    <li>Elijah was fed by the Angel of Yahweh before setting off to Horeb [<em>1Kgs 19:7</em>]</li>
    <li>Elijah travelled miraculously for 40 days with the strength from the food [<em>1Kgs 19:7-8</em>].</li>
    <li>Yahweh met with Elijah at Horeb [<em>1Kgs 19:10</em>].</li>
