<header><h1>Points from of Matthew 24.</h1></header>
<h2>Main Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Jesus said that Jerusalem would not see Him again until they cry out: &ldquo;Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord&rdquo; [<em>Mat 23:29</em>]; that is to say, He would be hidden from them until they recognize who He is. Then He told them
        that the temple would be destroyed. In response to that, they ask Him when what He had said would be and how they would know when He returns [<em>Mat 24:2-3</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus&rsquo; first charge to His people is to avoid being deceived</li>
    <li>He proceeds to tell them more things that will happen but still does not answer their question.</li>
    <li>He tells them to flee when they see the abomination that causes desolation. No one should think of going back to get property &ndash; not even clothing items &ndash; when they hear of the abomination.</li>
    <li>Those who will be in Judea during the tribulation are to pray that their flight would not take place on the Sabbath or in winter, because movement would be harder in those days</li>
</ul>
<h2>Side</strong> Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It was David who organized the Levites and designed the temple that Solomon eventually built. God did not allow him build the temple because he was a man of war, and the temple was to be a house of prayer for ALL NATIONS. It would be improper that
        the man who fought many nations to build a temple for all nations to worship</li>
</ul>
