<header><h1>A Few Lessons from Job 13</h1></header>
<ul>
    <li>To speak when there is nothing to say I foolishness and it is wisdom to keep silent when there is nothing to say [<em>Job 13:5</em>].</li>
    <li>We are not meant to lie to defend God, for He will not praise us for doing so, but will punish [<em>Job 13:7-11</em>].</li>
</ul>
<h1>Re-examining the Doctrine of the Trinity</h1>
<ol>
    <li>The mandate of Nebuchadnezzar as king of kings was the same Adam&rsquo;s mandate. They were to have dominion over all the men, nations, and beasts [<em>Dan 2:37-38</em>].</li>
    <li>Everything that happens in this present age is by the decree of angels [<em>Dan 4:17</em>]. This age is ruled by angels.</li>
