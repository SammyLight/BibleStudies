    <!--excerpt.start--><li>All things belong to God and are in His service. This includes both good and evil beings and things [<em>1Kgs 22:20-23; Isa 10:5</em>].</li>
    <li>Holiness is to be like God</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>The more one is like God, the holier he is.</li>
    <li>Holiness is being set apart or sanctified to God.</li>
    <li>Holiness is not always righteous as in the case of the nation of Israel who is holy to God but has been an unrighteous nation, but righteousness is required or expected or holiness.</li>
    <li>Righteousness is also required of the unholy, although it is not exactly expected of them as it is from the holy.</li>
    <li>Both the holy and the unholy have access to God [<em>1Kgs</em><em>22: 20-23; Rev 12:7-8; Mat 18:10</em>].</li>
    <li>Though both the holy and unholy have access to God, the holy are special to God.</li>
    <li>Some benefits of access to God are Life, eternal pleasure [<em>Psa 16:11</em>] and free food, glorious shelter, security/protection, servants, comfort etc.</li>
    <li>Some benefits of special access to God are eternal life, divine glory, royalty, power, and the Holy Spirit.</li>
    <li>The care given to the holy is more than that given to the unholy.</li>
    <li>The service of the holy are more important to God than the service of the unholy.</li>
    <li>Darkness is easy to generate than light. All it requires for darkness to exist is the absence of light. The absence of darkness cannot cause light.</li>
    <li>Holiness requires more power.</li>
    <li>Since the inhabitants of heaven are holy, then those who have access to heaven are holy by default. Therefore, even the dark powers are holy.</li>
    <li>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Light, of Life, of Truth [<em>Joh 8:44; 17:17</em>] and of Glory. Satan only masquerades as an angel of light. He has no light in himself. Satan does not have the Holy Spirit.</li>
