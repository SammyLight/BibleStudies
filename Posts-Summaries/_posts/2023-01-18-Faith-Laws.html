<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>Proximity to power matters
        <ul>
            <li>This can be seen in the story of Jesus saying the Apostles need not fast when He is with them [<em>Mat 17:21; 9:14-15</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
            <li>When power is near, God answers prayers faster as in the case of king Hezekiah&rsquo;s illness. No sooner had the prayer left the king&rsquo;s mouth than God responded by sending the prophet Isaiah who was still in the palace with an answer
                for king Hezekiah.</li>
            <li>These principles are still in place in the New Testament.</li>
            <li>Like Christians today, Korah challenged Moses, claiming that he too was a prophet. We should avoid the rebellion of Korah by recognizing those God has anointed above us. God recognizes seniority.</li>
            <li>God healed king Hezekiah using medicine. He could have just sent the word for Hezekiah to be healed but He chose to use medicine. Medicine that would not have worked otherwise [<em>2Kgs 20:7</em>].</li>
            <li>The word of God as a sign to king Hezekiah for the sun to go back 10 steps had already gone out yet, Isaiah still had to pray for it to happen [<em>2Kgs 20:8-11</em>]. Though Elijah had said that rain would fall (obviously on God&rsquo;s command),
                he still prayed fervently before the rain came. Because God gives a word, does not mean there is no need for prayer.</li>
            <li>When God gave Joshua the word that he would defeat his enemies, he marched all that night. He could have waited for the morning to go fight but he moved that same night and God honoured his swift action by causing his night march to terrify
                his enemies [<em>Josh 10:1-13</em>].</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
