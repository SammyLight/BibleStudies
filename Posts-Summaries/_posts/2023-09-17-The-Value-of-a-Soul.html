<header><h1>The Value of a Soul</h1></header>
<ol>
    <li>The resurrection is extremely valuable
        <ol>
            <!--excerpt.start--><li>The value of <strong>a</strong> soul is too costly, and no payment is ever enough [Psa 49:8].</li>
            <li>Jesus says <strong>a</strong> soul is more costly than the entire world [Mat 16:26].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
            <li>This means the resurrection for <strong>each</strong> soul is more valuable than the entire earth.</li>
            <li>Each resurrected saint is worth more than the entire earth.</li>
            <li>The redemption is giving new glorious bodies.</li>
            <li>Power-wise, the resurrected body of each saint is more powerful than this entire world [Eph 1:17-20].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Since God gives each saint power greater than the earth at the resurrection, then:
        <ol>
            <li>The least among us has power over the earth</li>
            <li>Why would one have the power to create things if he is not to create?</li>
            <li>Is the power to create just for bringing us back to life? Is there not more?</li>
            <li>God did not just make Esther queen because He wanted the king to have a new wife, but because He wanted to save Israel. In the same way, God gives us the resurrection &ndash; with the power that accompanies it, the power greater than the world
                &ndash; for a purpose beyond the resurrection; a purpose beyond this world.</li>
            <li>God gives us creation power (<em>seeing as our bodies are more powerful than the earth</em>), perhaps because He needs us to use creation power.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God said Abraham&rsquo;s seed would be as countable as the stars of heaven. Meaning, not just that they would be innumerable, but also that they will shine like the stars &ndash; as Daniel&rsquo;s prophecy confirms [Gen 15:5; Dan 12:2-3].</li>
