<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>John wrote as if the reader already knows the life of Jesus. He expects the readers to know of the Mary who anointed Jesus&rsquo; feet [<em>Joh 1:3</em>].</li>
    <li>John considered those among the rulers of Israel who played it safe by not confessing Jesus &ndash; despite their belief in him &ndash; because of fear of being put out of the Synagogue to be cowards [<em>Joh 12:42-43</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>It is not that they did not love the praise of God; it was that they loved the praise of men more than they loved God [<em>Joh 12:43</em>].</li>
    <li>The doctrine of the trinity makes Jesus the hero at God&rsquo;s expense. If the &ldquo;Godhead&rdquo; (as they say) is equal in power, authority, wisdom etc, then He is the only one who really did the work in dying for us.</li>
    <li>The Father is the one who sent Jesus. It is the Father who initiated the work. It does not rob Jesus of His glory and praise for His obeying the Father.</li>
    <li>Jesus teaches hoe to interpret scripture when He says to His disciples that He goes to prepare a place for them [<em>Joh 14:2-3</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus&rsquo; statement to Philip in John 14:9 confirms that He is the Angel of Yahweh. Philip asked to be shown the Father, but Jesus said, &ldquo;anyone who has seen me has seen the Father&rdquo;. It is only the Angel of Yahweh we know to be the
        One men saw and equated to God [<em>Joh 14:9</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus&rsquo; miracles were done through Him by the Father, because He is in the Father and the Father is in Him [<em>Joh 14:11</em>].</li>
    <li>The world will not see Jesus upon His return. They will see the sign of His return, but will not actually see Him. It is those who see Him who will explain to the nations what they witnessed upon the day of His return [<em>Joh 14:19-21; Mat 24:30; Isa 66:19</em>].</li>
    <li>Those who love God are those who have His commands and obey them [<em>Joh 14:21</em>].</li>
    <li>Those who love Jesus obey His teaching [<em>Joh 14:23</em>].</li>
