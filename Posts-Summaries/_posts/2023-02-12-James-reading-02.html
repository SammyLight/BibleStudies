<header><h1>Points from of James.</h1></header>
<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>We are to rejoice and be patient in tribulation [<em>Jas 1:2</em>].</li>
    <li>When patience has done its complete work, we will be perfect and want nothing [<em>Jas 1:4</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>Wisdom will not come through tribulation or patience but when we ask [<em>Jas 1:5</em>].</li>
    <li>Wavering in verse 6 does not mean doubt as the NIV translates it. It means to not be fully devoted to God [<em>Jas 1:6</em>].</li>
    <li>The one who is tempted is not tempted by God but by his own evil desires [<em>Jas 1:23-15</em>].</li>
    <li>James teaches that we unlike when we look in our faces in the mirrors and forget our appearance, we should not forget the word of God but keep it ever before us [<em>Jas 1:23-25</em>].</li>
    <li>Knowing and having faith in God means nothing if we do not act accordingly. Even demons know and fear Him, but they still do evil [<em>Jas 2:17-19</em>].</li>
    <li>James teaches that Abraham was declared righteous by God but there was no proof, so there was a test to confirm what God had said [<em>Jas 2:21-23</em>]. (See audio recording for clarity).</li>
    <li>A man who can control his tongue can control his entire body [<em>Jas 3:2</em>].</li>
    <li>The double-mindedness of which James spoke [<em>Jas 1:6-8</em>] is further explained as love of the world; which is also enmity against God [<em>Jas 4:1-4</em>].</li>
    <li>James said we should draw near to God by purifying our hands and hearts (deeds and thoughts), and to humble ourselves in mourning [<em>Jas 4:8-10</em>].</li>
    <li>It is a sin to brag about what we plan to do; we are to depend on God instead [<em>Jas 4:13-17</em>].</li>
</ul>
<h1>Our Goals as God&rsquo;s People According to James</h1>
<ol>
    <li>A crown of life from God (i.e., eternal life) [<em>Jas 1:12</em>].</li>
    <li>The righteousness of God [<em>Jas 1:20</em>].</li>
    <li>The salvation of our souls [<em>Jas 1:21</em>].</li>
    <li>Being justified (avoiding condemnation) [<em>Jas 3:1-2</em>].</li>
</ol>
