<h1>Other Points</h1>
<ol>
    <li>We should know exactly what we ask God. Ben Hadad did not ask whether or not he would live, but whether or not he would die from that particular illness. God was right, he would have recovered from the illness, but he died regardless &ndash; according
        to the word of God [<em>2Kgs 8:7-13</em>].</li>
    <li>The prayer &ldquo;let your will be done&rdquo; as taught by Jesus [<em>Matt 6:10</em>] is contextual. It does not mean we should not pray for things we need and to make our case, but that God&rsquo;s ultimate will (i.e., righteousness on the earth)
        be done.</li>
    <li>The disciples were first the Father&rsquo;s before He gave them to Jesus [<em>J0h 17:6</em>].</li>
    <li>Like Jesus, we should be careful in our prayers and enquiries. He guarded against any misunderstanding of His prayer for His disciples. He said He was not of the world and was going back to God [<em>Joh 17:13-14</em>]; one could also say that since
        we also are not of the world, that we too should be removed from the world. Jesus guarded against this mistaking of His words by clarifying that God should keep us in the world and protect us from the evil one [<em>Joh 17:14-15</em>]. If Ben-Hadad
        had this wisdom, when he sought to know his fate from Elisha, he might not have died at the hands of Hazael.</li>
    <li>Elisha&rsquo;s decree of Hazael becoming king of Syria was in fulfilment of God&rsquo;s word to Elijah to anoint Hazael as king of Syria [<em>1Kgs 19:15</em>].</li>
    <li>It important to note that Elisha&rsquo;s anointing of Hazael as king is the same as if Elijah did it.</li>
    <li>Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat became king and did evil before God as the kings of Israel because of his wife, the daughter of Ahab [<em>2Kgs 8:16-18</em>].</li>
    <li>There is an important focus on the wives and mothers of various men in scriptures. God wants us to see that women have influence over the lives of their men.</li>
    <li>Jehoshaphat &ndash; although he almost lost his life over his friendship with the house of Ahab &ndash; was able to maintain his righteousness despite his friendship with Ahab. His son on the other hand, did not have the same discernment he did and
        ended up being evil. If Jehoshaphat had not been friends with the house of Ahab, it is unlikely that his son would have ended up being evil. If Jehoshaphat had taught his son properly, his son would have had similar discernment and would have
        been able to be friends with the house of Ahab and still maintain his righteousness like his father.</li>
    <li>Prophets were seen as mad people in those days [<em>2Kgs 9:11; Hos 9:7</em>]</li>
