<header><h1>Points from John 3 &ndash; 5.</h1></header>
<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>Jesus is called &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; by John in the first chapter, because He speaks the words of God [<em>Joh 3:31-34</em>].</li>
    <li>Job asked His friends what spirit spoke through them [<em>Job 26:4</em>], which means that spirits speak through people. Since Jesus has the Spirit of God without measure [<em>Joh 3:34</em>], He speaks the words of God like no other.</li>
    <li>The Jews who said Jesus made Himself equal with God did not believe in the trinity, therefore, this portion of scripture does not prove that God is a trinity. They had a non-trinitarian understanding of what Jesus meant when He claimed to be equal
        with God [<em>Joh 5:18</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>The Jews called God their Father [<em>Joh 8:41</em>], but were offended when they said Jesus claimed to be equal to God. They were angry and sought to kill Him because He claimed that His Father (God) works [on the Sabbath], so He too works [on the
        Sabbath]. The Jews were sons of God, but were prohibited from working on the Sabbath, so if Jesus called God His father in the context of working on the Sabbath, they knew He meant His sonship was not as theirs, but a higher level of Sonship.
        [<em>Joh 5:18</em>]. Jesus was claiming to be an actual Son and not just a servant son as were the Jews.</li>
    <li>There are two resurrections in John 5. Jesus speaks of one resurrection where the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live [<em>Joh 5:25</em>]; and He speaks of the resurrection where ALL who are in their graves will
        hear His voice and rise [<em>Joh 5:28-29</em>].</li>
    <li>There are two groups of people who partake of the Last Resurrection. Those who have done good will rise to life, and those who did not do good, will rise to condemnation [<em>Joh 5:28-29</em>].</li>
