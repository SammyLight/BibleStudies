<header><h1>Points from of Hebrews 11.</h1></header>
<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>Abel&rsquo;s faith taught him what was pleasing to God and his faith pleased God [<em>Heb 11:4</em>].</li>
    <li>Faith believes that there is God and that He rewards those who seek him diligently. This teaches that if one does not diligently seek God, there will be no reward. Just as Abel knew that God would reward him for diligent sacrifice, but Cain sought
        God through his sacrifice but not diligently [<em>Heb 11:4-6</em>]</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>Noah&rsquo;s faith made him afraid after God warned him of the coming flood (<em>the evidence of things not seen</em>). Faith can bring fear. Noah inherited the earth after the flood because of His righteousness.</li>
    <li>Abraham knew that God could raise Isaac from the dead, so he did not protest when God asked Him to sacrifice Isaac.</li>
    <li>Isaac blessed Jacob by faith. The faith here is not that anyone can just bless another, but that Abraham had passed on the blessing and so Isaac too passed it down to his son. No random person could have blessed Jacob or anyone with that kind of blessing.
        Faith here is that specific to Isaac passing down the blessing.</li>
</ul>
