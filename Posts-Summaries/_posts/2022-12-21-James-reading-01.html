<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--> <li>Faith is not a New Testament concept that Jesus brought. People before the time of Jesus knew and practiced faith. Abraham believed God, Elizabeth and Mary believed God [<em>Luk 1:45</em>]. <em>Hebrews 11</em>is a list of Old Testament characters who
        had faith.</li><!--excerpt.end-->
        <li>Mary knew she was humble [<em>Luk 1:48</em>]. It is not a sin for one to know he is humble and for him to speak of it.</li>
