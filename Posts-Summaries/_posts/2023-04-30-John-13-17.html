<ol>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>The Father is greater than Jesus because Jesus was sent by the Father [<em>Joh 14:16</em>].</li>
    <li>Women are to be known for service.</li>
    <li>Receiving Jesus is receiving God who sent Him. Before Jesus, receiving Moses, or any of the true prophets was receiving God [<em>Joh 14:20</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>Jesus also gave to the poor [<em>Joh 14:39</em>].</li>
    <li>The Father is glorified in the Son, when the Son completes the work the Father sent Him to do [<em>Joh 17:1-4</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus loved His own to the end, and showed them the full extent of His love [<em>Joh 13:1</em>]. How does Jesus show them His love
        <ol>
            <li>He washed their feet (i.e., He served them).</li>
            <li>He intends to take them to be with Him [<em>Joh 14:3</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The disciples were washed by the word Jesus taught them [<em>Joh 15:3</em>]</li>
    <li>Without Jesus, we can do nothing. This verse seems to teach that the fruit we are to bear in Him is power [<em>Joh 15:1-5</em>].</li>
</ol>
<p>Those who reject the Apostles&rsquo; words are persecuting them [<em>Joh 15:20</em>], and are actually disobeying and persecuting Jesus.</p>
