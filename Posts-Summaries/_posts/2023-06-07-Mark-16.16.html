<header><h1>Is the List in Mark 16:16 Exhaustive?</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start--><p>No. It cannot be an exhaustive list because of the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The fact that they can all speak in tongues, and that this will in fact be &ldquo;all tongues&rdquo;, since we are to be one, [<em>Joh 17:22</em>] and speaking languages other do not understand makes us strangers [<em>1Cor 14:10-11</em>], then we
        know that we will also understand, and not just speak those languages</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>We will certainly understand all human languages since the Church is coming from all tribes and languages and peoples and nations [<em>Rev 5:9</em>], we will have to understand the language being spoken by one another</li>
    <li>Isaiah speaks of other powers such as:
        <ol>
            <li>Supernatural strength, speed, and stamina [<em>Isa 40:29-31; 1Kgs 18:46</em>]</li>
            <li>Flight [<em>Isa 40:31</em>]</li>
            <li>We will not drown in water or be burned by fire [<em>Isa 43:2; Rev 20:14,6; Dan 3:25-27</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>We will have power over the elements, which means we will be able to do miracles in general [<em>Gal 4:3</em>]</li>
</ol>
