<header><h1>Points from 2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 10.</h1></header>
<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>We win spiritual battles using wisdom, not strength.</li>
    <li>Battles won by force, would have to be maintained by force.</li>
    <li>We wage war by taking the minds of people captive.</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>We use irrefutable arguments to take the minds captive..</li>
    <li>God makes an argument in Isaiah 43 that He was the one who declared the former things and declare new things and challenges the gods to declare the future if they can.</li>
    <li>Prophecy is not God seeing the future, but God declaring/determining the future</li>
    <li>To imply that God sees rather than determining it is to say He has no control over the future, which means the future is greater than God.</li>
    <li>Devils steal prophecies when they hear God first decree them.</li>
    <li>Resurrection &ndash; being one of the new things God declared &ndash; is a uniquely Judaeo-Christian doctrine. The only other religion that speaks of the resurrection copied it from the Bible.</li>
</ul>
