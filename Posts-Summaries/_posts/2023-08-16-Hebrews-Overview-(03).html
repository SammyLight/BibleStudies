    <!--excerpt.start--><li>Jesus will render unemployed/idle/useless, the one who holds the power of death [Heb 2:14].
        <ol>
            <li>This is contrary to the belief that Jesus will annihilate/destroy/kill Satan.</li>
            <li>The word translated &lsquo;destroy&rsquo; in the verse is &lsquo;<strong><em>katarg&eacute;ō</em></strong>&rsquo;, means to render something inactive or ineffective<!--excerpt.end-->
                <ol>
                    <li>In Luke 13:7, <strong><em>katarg&eacute;ō </em></strong>means to be useless</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus helps Abraham&rsquo;s sons (human beings), not angels [Heb 2:16].
                <ol>
                    <li>This helps guard against those who believe in eternal reconciliation (i.e., the doctrine that God is reconciling Satan and other devils to Himself, along with humans).</li>
                    <li>The doctrine of eternal reconciliation is derived from a misinterpretation of [Colossians 1:20]</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus&rsquo; is a compassionate High Priest, as He deals compassionately with the Ignorant and the wayward [Heb 5:1-2].
                <ol>
                    <li>These are the same reasons why God rejected Israel in the wilderness; ignorance and waywardness (<strong><em>plan&aacute;ō</em></strong>) [Heb 3:10]</li>
                    <li>It&rsquo;s not for those who miss the way continually
                        <ol>
                            <li>God says they &lsquo;<strong>always</strong>&rsquo; go astray. This means that our High Priest deals compassionately with those who don&rsquo;t continually go astray [Heb 3:10]</li>
                            <li>The same Hebrews say those who persist in sin will not have cover for their sins [Heb 6:4-8]</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>He deals with the ignorant by teaching them. He doesn&rsquo;t leave them in ignorance
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Messenger who finds atonement for a man, does so - not only by pleading on his behalf - but also by teaching him what is right for him [Job 33:31-28].</li>
                            <li>Jesus&rsquo; atonement and intercession cannot be different.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Angels still intercede for us as Christians under the New Covenant.
        <ol>
            <li>Angels behold the Father&rsquo;s face [Mat18:10] not to exchange pleasantries, but obviously to intercede on our behalf</li>
            <li>Angels who minister to those who will inherit salvation [Heb 1:14].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Over the centuries (since His ascension), Jesus has not just been interceding for the church, but teaching the Church.</li>
