    <li>The husband of the proverbs 31 woman is an elder at the gates of the city; i.e., he&rsquo;s a respectable man, yet his wife worked [Pro 31:13-24]. She was no housewife who just sat at home but a businesswoman.

            <li>King Xerxes called for Vashti to display her beauty to his officials, just as God called Job to be displayed before His officials &ndash; the heavenly council.</li>
            <li>The noble woman is nice and generous [Pro 31:20]</li>
            <li><strong>The wife is the one who watches over the affairs of the household, not the husband [Pro 31:27]</strong>.</li>
            <li>A woman is not to be praised for beauty or charm, but for her fear of God, and by implication, the godly attributes that come with it [Pro 31:30].</li>
