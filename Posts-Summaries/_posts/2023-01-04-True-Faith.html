<header><h1>True Faith.</h1></header>
<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>The <strong>true faith</strong> is belief in God and His Son Jesus [<em>Jn 14:1; 1Tim 2:5-7 {NIV}</em>].
        <ul>
            <li>Other religions may claim to be the faith, but this is the true faith.</li><!--excerpt.end-->
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Samaritans worshipped God, but Jesus said they did not know what they worshipped for salvation is of the Jews [<em>Jn 4:22</em>].</li>
    <li>The faith of God &ndash; our faith &ndash; teaches God&rsquo;s ways, His laws, His judgements, His past, present and future deeds, His revelation, His purposes etc.</li>
    <li>The immediate goal for us as people of the faith is eternal life. This is the pursuit of all humanity; a pleasant and lasting life.</li>
    <li>Our faith reveals to us God&rsquo;s plan and His way to life.</li>
    <li>Moses boasts of the things Israel had over all nations through the Law; God&rsquo;s wisdom, God&rsquo;s righteousness, His justice and judgments, and His power [<em>Deu 4:5-8</em>].</li>
    <li>If Christianity &ndash; the true faith of God &ndash; is not the way, then there is no other way [<em>Jn 14:6</em>].</li>
    <li>Christianity is the only religion that offers the way to eternal life [<em>Jn 17:2</em>].</li>
    <li>There is no religion, no faith that offers life. God is the only one that can give life. The woman of Zarephath confirmed Elijah as a true prophet of God after he prayed to God to bring her son back to life and God answered [<em>1kgs 17:17-24</em>].</li>
    <li>Death is God&rsquo;s judgement on the world, and He alone has the antidote</li>
    <li>Peter&rsquo;s faith here was not confidence that he could walk on water, rather, His faith was that he asked Jesus to permit him to come and Jesus obliged [<em>Mat 14:20-36</em>].</li>
