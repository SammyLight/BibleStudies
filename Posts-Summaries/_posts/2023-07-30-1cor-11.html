<header><h1>1<sup>st</sup> Cor 11 - Man Head of Woman</h1></header>
<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>The doctrine Paul taught that women should cover their heads while praying and prophesying is a doctrine of Christ. We know this because, before Paul taught it, he said we should imitate him as he imitates Christ [1Cor 11:1]. Paul was imitating
        Christ, when he taught the doctrine of head covering.</li>
    <li>Paul said he taught only milk to the Corinthians. Therefore, this message of head covering is milk [1Cor 3:1-3].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>The gospel is not only to believe in Jesus, but the ordinances/traditions that Paul handed down to the Church [1Cor 11:2].</li>
    <li>Paul delivering traditions to the Corinthians (<em>and other Churches</em>) is him imitating Christ [1Cor 11:2,1].</li>
    <li>Man (<em>as a whole</em>) is the head of woman (<em>as a whole</em>), not just husbands being over their wives, just as every general is superior to every sergeant, even though sergeants may be under specific generals and not under every single general
        directly.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Because of the Angels [1Cor 11:10]</h1>
<p>Paul says women are to have a sign of authority over their heads because of the angels [1Cor 11:10]. The gathering of the Church is not simply about Christ, but about God, therefore, the administration of God/the Heaven must be considered.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We are still under the administration of angels [Heb 2:5; Acts 7:53; Gal 3:19; Luk 12:8; 1Tim 5:21; Matt 16:27; Mar 8:38; Luk 9:26].
        <ul>
            <li>Angels make decrees for this age. Heaven as a whole rules over this age [Dan 4:13,17,23-26].</li>
            <li>Nebuchadnezzer and Daniel use the words &lsquo;Most High&rsquo; (God) and &lsquo;Heavens&rsquo; interchangeably. They understand that heaven&rsquo;s decree is God&rsquo;s decree [Dan 4:13,17,23-26]. This is the same reason why the
                New Testament writers use the phrases &lsquo;Kingdom of Heaven&rsquo; and &lsquo;Kingdom of God&rsquo; interchangeably.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Church is God&rsquo;s Church in Christ [1Cor 11:16].</li>
    <li>In the order established by heaven, man is above woman [Gen 2:18 (see LXX translation)]. Even though we are in Christ where man and woman are somewhat equal, we are still under the administration of heaven, and that arrangement must be observed.
        To disrespect it is to disrespect God and the angels (i<em>.e., the heavenly council</em>).</li>
