<ul>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>When the apostles speaks of Jesus before His incarnation, they do not refer to Him as Jesus, but as the word [<em>Joh 1:1</em>], the Spiritual Rock [<em>1Co 10:4</em>] etc.</li>
    <li>This is because He was not Jesus (by name) before His incarnation.</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>If Jesus&rsquo; brother&rsquo;s believed in Him, they would not have questioned His way of doing things [<em>Joh 7:3-5</em>].</li>
    <li>Believing in Jesus is believing that He is the Son of God, the Christ, [<em>Joh 20:30-31</em>], not just a prophet or a miracle worker.</li>
    <li>God gave them miracles that they might believe that He (Jesus) is the Son of God.</li>
    <li>If the people believed, they would not have been asking Jesus for signs.</li>
    <li>Jesus asked the people to examine His doctrine, to find out whether His teaching comes from God, or He speaks on His own [<em>Joh 7:17</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus did not speak of Himself [<em>Joh 7:17</em>].</li>
    <li>One of the ways heaven measures righteousness is by whether or not you seek God&rsquo;s glory [<em>Joh 7:19</em>].</li>
    <li>Because God promises something does not mean it will always happen immediately. Jesus said He would give living water to the thirsty who asked. However, John says He spoke of the Holy Spirit He would give to them after His glorification [<em>Joh 7:37-39</em>].
        This means that if they had asked at the time He told them to, they would not have received the Holy Spirit, because Christ had not yet been glorified.</li>
    <li>The Father is the God of Israel [<em>Joh 8:54</em>]</li>
