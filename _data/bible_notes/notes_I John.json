Surely, saying that one is to be cleansed from sin means that one has sin. It is like promising freedom to a man who is not in bondage [Joh 8:33 cf., Joh 8:31-32].</p><p>Very clearly, John is writting to justify his saying that “the blood of Jesus Christ ...cleanseth us from all sin” implying that the cleansing is still on going <em>(as explained in the note to the preceding verse [1Joh 1:7])</em>.</p><p>That Christians can still sin is clear from the fact that John writes in this letter about a brother who sins and who is to be prayed for [1Joh 5:16]</p>",
