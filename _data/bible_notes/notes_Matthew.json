We should observe that but for verse 30, we wouldn’t have understood what Jesus really meant by his coming being <em>“as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west”</em>. So, verse 30 clearly corresponds to verse 27 becaue they both speak of Jesus’ coming and in verse 30 Jesus makes clear what he meant in verse 27.</p><p>Now, both verses 28 and 31 clearly correspond by their speaking of “gathering” to a central point. So, just as 30 explained 27, we can see that 31 is the explanation for 28 and so we see that Jesus was speaking of the gathering of his elect to him by the figure of eagles gathered to the carcase.</p><p>We can see that both pairs of verses are parallel to each other and the preceding pair [Mat 24:27-28] is explained in the pair that follows [Mat 24:30-31].</p><h3>Jesus a “Carcase”?!</h3><p>It may be hard to accept this meaning because of the representation of Jesus as a “carcase”. However, this should’t be regarded as strange because Jesus later describes himself as a “<strong>thief </strong>” in the night [Mat 24:43]. We could cite other examples.</p><p>Though under the Law of Moses eagles are unclean animals, yet God is described as an eagle and his people as eaglets [Deu 32:11].</p><p>In any case, Jesus really is a “carcase” because by the standard of blood being the life/soul of the flesh [Gen 9:4; Lev 17:11], can still be considered dead since Jesus after his death and resurrection no longer has blood [Luk 24:39 cf., 1Cor 15:50].</p>",

Eagles/vultures  are birds and they certainly fly--they fly high “toward heaven” [<span ref=\"Pro.23.5\"><span ref=\"Pro.23.5\">Pro 23:5</span></span>]. Therefore, since we are to be gathered to him in the sky, he apparently choses this expression because of that.<br></li><li>Significantly, in connection to the Day of Yahweh, the day when Jesus comes, the very day he is speaking of here, Yahweh describes himself and his holy ones as “birds hovering” <span ref=\"Isa.31.5\"><span ref=\"Isa.31.5\">Isa 31:5</span></span>.<br></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>Therefore, Jesus using this figure is quite understandable and appropriate.</p><h2>Confirmation of Conclusion From <span ref=\"Luke.17.36-37\"><span ref=\"Luke.17.36-37\">Luke 17:36-37</span></span></h2><p>In Luke where Jesus spoke of his coming, he uses the same figure of speech in answer to the disciples question of where those who will be taken at his coming will be taken to. His answer was “Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.” [<span ref=\"Luk.17.37\"><span ref=\"Luk.17.37\">Luk 17:37</span></span>]</p><p>Before this question and his answer Jesus compared his coming to the days of Noah and Lot [<span ref=\"Luk.17.26-27,28-29\"><span ref=\"Luk.17.26-27,28-29\">Luk 17:26-27,28-29</span></span>] and for both, those who were destroyed were those who did not leave. Therefore, clearly, to be “left” wherever one was when the Lord comes and not be “taken” is not desirable.</p><p>Therefore, the gathering of eagles to the body is to be saved like Noah and Lot were, to be removed from the danger. Now, since it is by the gathering of the saints to the Lord on the day of his coming that they will be saved from the destruction of that day, then again, clearly, the Lord is the body to which the elect as eagles are gathered/taken.</p>",
