		    <header><h1>The Parable of Jacob&rsquo;s Reunion with Esau [Genesis 32-32]</h1></header>
    <!--excerpt.start--><p>After Jacob left Laban. He got to a place where he met God&rsquo;s angels and he called the place the Camp of God and named it Mahanaim. From there, Jacob sent his servants ahead of him to Seir where Esau lived to find favour with him. Jacob&rsquo;s servants
        returned to tell him that Esau was on his way to intercept them with a convoy of 400 of men. Jacob &ndash; in fear &ndash; prays to God for protection, divides his camp in two, and sends many gifts ahead of him to Esau to atone for himself. Jacob
        then meets and Angel and they wrestle till the Angel changes Jacob&rsquo;s name to Israel. After this, Jacob is reunited with his brother Esau who is happy to see him. Esau makes an offer to Israel to come live with him in Seir, but Jacob tactfully
        declines and instead moves with his camp to Succoth where he settles with his family.</p><!--excerpt.end-->
