    <li>What really is prophecy? <em>Gen 41:25; Isa 48:3-7; Amos 3:7</em>
        <ul>
            <li>A divine revelation of the future</li>
            <li><strong>God's decrees and judgments</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When Joseph interpreted Pharaoh&rsquo;s dream, he said to Pharaoh that God had revealed to
                        Pharaoh what He (God) was about to do [Gen 41:25]. Pharaoh&rsquo;s dream was a prophecy of the 7
                        years of abundance and 7 years of famine that
                        were to come. This &ndash; according to Joseph &ndash; was not some prediction by God of what
                        lay ahead, but of what God was about to do.
                    </li>
                    <li>God speaking through Isaiah, says; <strong>I foretold the former things long ago</strong>, my
                        mouth announced them and I made them known; <strong>then suddenly I acted</strong>, and they
                        came to pass. [NIV'78 Isa 48:3]. God here claims
                        to have made earlier prophecies, prophecies whose fulfilment lingered until He acted then they
                        came to pass. This means that the things God prophesied earlier did not happen until He
                        <strong>ACTED</strong>. Had God not <strong>ACTED</strong>,
                        the words He spoke would not have happened.
                    </li>
                    <li>God says [Amos 3:7] that He does nothing without first revealing His plans to His servants the
                        prophets. This means that prophecy is not God predicting the future but God determining the
                        future. If God says through His prophets that
                        He would do something, He was revealing His plans. Plans are things that have not yet happened,
                        but one intends to do. So if God says He would <strong>DO</strong> nothing without telling His
                        servants, it means what will happen (i.e.,
                        the future) has not yet happened, it means God has not yet <strong>DONE</strong> what He
                        revealed to His servants, the prophets. All these teach clearly, that prophecy is neither
                        prediction of the future nor the decree of a man of
                        God but a revelation of God&rsquo;s decrees and judgments.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;The decree of a true man of God concerning a situation</li>
            <li>None of the Above</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Prophets are? <em>See the explanation to the answer to question 1</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Men who can work miracles at will</li>
            <li><strong>Men who speak for God</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>According to the explanation for question 1, Prophecy is God telling His servants (the prophets)
                        what He intends to do. This being the case, then a Prophet is one who speaks for God. This does
                        not mean that they do not work miracles
                        or speak against injustice etc. A prophet may do these things, but his primary duty is to speak
                        for God. There are prophets in scripture to whom no miracle is attributed such as Amos, Nahum,
                        John the Baptist [Joh 10:41] etc;
                        yet they are prophets regardless. Men can speak out against injustices but that does not make
                        them prophets.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Men who speak against injustice in the nation</li>
            <li>Men of God who shape the future by their authoritative prophetic declarations</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the revelation of God and his will, as presented in the Bible, which is the most important? <em>1Cor
            12:28</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Prophets</li>
            <li>Pastors and teachers</li>
            <li><strong>Apostles</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Paul explained the hierarchy in the Church [1Cor 12:28]. In this hierarchy, he placed the
                        apostles as first, the prophets as second, teachers as third and so on.</li>
                    <li>The importance of apostles can even be seen in that the prophets did not always have a full
                        understanding of their prophecies and had to search diligently to understand it [1Pet 1:10-11].
                        The apostles &ndash; beginning with Jesus
                        [Heb 3:1] &ndash; are the ones who explained the writings that some of the prophets did not
                        understand.</li>
                    <li>This means that apostles are the most important in the revelation of God&rsquo;s will.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Evangelists</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Who was the first apostle?
        <ul>
            <li>Paul</li>
            <li>Peter</li>
            <li>Moses</li>
            <li><strong>Adam</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scripture subtly lays out the criteria that must be met before one can be considered an apostle.
                        Knowing these criteria, we can deduce the identity of the first apostle.</li>
                    <li>Miriam and Aaron challenged Moses for taking a Cushite wife [Exo 12]. Their audacity to
                        challenge Moses came from the fact they too were prophets just as was Moses. In God&rsquo;s
                        rebuke to them, He did not deny that they were
                        prophets (for they indeed were), but He made it clear to them that Moses was something more than
                        a prophet. God said that, in speaking to prophets, He speaks through dreams and visions but that
                        He was different with Moses;
                        God said He spoke to Moses <strong>face to face</strong>, <strong>clearly and without
                            riddles</strong> and that Moses <strong>saw the likeness of God</strong>. Here, God teaches
                        that there are prophets to whom He speaks through
                        dreams and visions, to whom He does not speak clearly but in riddles and who do not see His
                        likeness but there are also prophets (who are obviously more than regular prophets) to whom He
                        speaks to face to face, to whom He speaks
                        clearly and not in riddles and who see His likeness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jesus spoke</strong> to His apostles <strong>plainly (clearly)</strong> rather than use
                        <strong>parables (riddles)</strong> [Mat 13:10-23] and He said that<strong> seeing Him was the
                            same as seeing the Father</strong> God [Joh
                        14:9], so the apostles had in fact, seen God. The apostles were also known to<strong> work great
                            miracles</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Paul, in trying to defend his apostleship said &ldquo;Am I not an apostle?<strong> Have I not
                            seen Jesus our Lord</strong>&rdquo; [1Cor 9:1] and in another place, he says<strong> signs,
                            wonders and miracles are marks of apostleship</strong> [1Cor
                        12:12].</li>
                    <li>Putting all these together, an apostle is one:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Who sees God face to face/sees God&rsquo;s likeness/has seen God Moses, the 12 and Paul
                                (among others in both old and new testaments).</li>
                            <li>To whom God speaks clearly and not in riddles like Moses, the 12 and Paul (among others
                                in both old and new testaments).</li>
                            <li>Who works great miracles like Moses, the 12 and Paul (among others in both old and new
                                testaments).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Before Moses, there was one man who met all these criteria that define an apostle. This man is
                        Adam. He clearly saw God, spoke to God face to face, had God speak to Him plainly and not in
                        riddles and he worked miracles in naming
                        the animals by the wisdom of God&rsquo;s Spirit. Adam was clearly the first apostle.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The testimony of God in the Bible is based on
        <ul>
            <li>Inspired observation of nature</li>
            <li><strong>First-hand testimony of the first human beings</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every book in the Bible is a recollection of human interaction with God, angels, and other
                        humans. Every prophet &ndash; from Moses to John &ndash; were telling what they heard from God,
                        or their interactions with other beings.
                        No author in scripture ever claimed to have gleaned their knowledge from observing nature.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The revelation of God to Moses</li>
            <li>The revelation of God to Abraham</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A man with the Spirit of God cannot misinterpret the Bible. <em>Gal 3:2</em>
        <ul>
            <li>True</li>
            <li><strong>False</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Paul rebuked the Galatians for their false belief that they needed to be circumcised and keep
                        the Law of Moses to be saved. In his rebuke, he said to them:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by observing
                                the law, or by believing what you heard? [Gal 3:2]</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>They received the Holy Spirit yet were in error. This is proof that having the Holy Spirit does
                        not guarantee that one will not misinterpret the Bible</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The key to understanding the Bible and not going astray is? <em>Isa 42:18-20; 1Pet 1:10-11</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning the creeds of the church</li>
            <li>Mastering the doctrines of the church fathers</li>
            <li><strong>Sincerity and paying attention to details</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see! Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the
                        messenger I send? Who is blind like the one committed to me, blind like the servant of the LORD?
                        <strong>You have seen many things but have paid no attention</strong>;
                        your ears are open, but you hear nothing." [NIV'78 Isa 42:18-20]</li>
                    <li>Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you<strong>,
                            searched intently and with the greatest care, trying to find out</strong> the time and
                        circumstances to which the Spirit of
                        Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that
                        would follow. [NIV'78 1Pet 1:10-11]</li>
                    <li>This shows that God wants His people to pay attention to His words. Receiving revelation
                        (prophecy) from God &ndash; as the prophets did &ndash; was by God&rsquo;s Spirit, yet the
                        prophets had to study diligently to understand
                        the revelations they received. If having the Spirit of God &ndash; as the prophets certainly did
                        &ndash; was sufficient to understand God&rsquo;s word, there would have been no need to
                        diligently search out the meaning
                        of the revelations.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Loving God and being spiritually alert</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The message of the Bible is? <em>Jesus&rsquo; teachings in the Parables</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Faith to get anything we want from God our Father</li>
            <li>How much God loves us</li>
            <li><strong>The Kingdom of God</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are many things written in the Old Testament that we would have been unable to understand
                        had Jesus not explained them. His apostles also did the same after Him. The doctrine of
                        justification by faith would have been
                        impossible to see, had Paul not laid it out as he did in his letters. The point is, if we are to
                        understand the Bible and its message, it would serve us best to turn to Jesus and His apostles
                        for what they believed
                        to be the message of the Bible.
                        <ul>
                            <li>John the Baptist taught the people to repent because the Kingdom of Heaven (of God) was
                                coming [Mat 3:2].</li>
                            <li>Jesus Taught the Kingdom
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Matthew summarizes Jesus&rsquo; preaching by saying that from the time after
                                        Jesus&rsquo; temptation, He began to preach to people to repent because of the
                                        coming of the Kingdom of Heaven [Mat 4:17].</li>
                                    <li>The sermon on the mount is Jesus giving instruction on what is required to enter
                                        the Kingdom of God [Mat 5-7].</li>
                                    <li>The parables of Jesus were mostly &ndash; if not solely &ndash; about the
                                        Kingdom of God.</li>
                                    <li>After His resurrection, Jesus was with His disciples for forty days, teaching
                                        about the Kingdom of God [Acts 1:3]</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Phillip preached the Kingdom of God when he went to Samaria [Acts 8:12]</li>
                            <li>Paul preached the Kingdom of God
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Paul preached the Kingdom of God after he was stoned at Derbe [Acts 14:19-22].
                                    </li>
                                    <li>He preached the Kingdom of God at Ephesus for three months [Acts 19:1-8]</li>
                                    <li>Paul Preached the Kingdom of God at Rome [Acts 28:16-31]</li>
                                    <li>Paul made references to the Kingdom of God in his letters [Rom 14:17; 1Cor 4:20;
                                        6:9-10; 15:50; Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5; Col 4:11; 2Ths 1:5; 2Tim 4:1, 18]</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>James wrote of the saints inheriting the Kingdom of God [Jas 2:5]</li>
                            <li>Peter wrote of the Kingdom of God [2Pet 1:11]</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Jesus and His apostles, in explaining the Old Testament to us, summarize the message of the
                        prophets as: The Kingdom of God</li>
                    <li>None of this means that the Bible does not teach faith, prophecy, or healing, or repentance, or
                        Jesus, or of God&rsquo;s love for us, or anything else that is genuinely found in scriptures.
                        Rather, this means that all these
                        other concepts in the Bible, are a part of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. Faith is not a
                        topic different from or independent of the Kingdom of God but a part of I; a requirement to
                        enter into the Kingdom of God.
                        In the same way, the love of God, healing and all other true Biblical concepts are aspects of
                        God&rsquo;s Kingdom.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>We cannot know the truth of God without the Bible
        <ul>
            <li><strong>True</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is in the Bible that God reveals Himself. In it, He explains what He is like and what He
                        likes [Jer 9:24], He gives us instructions on how to get life and prosperity the right way [Deu
                        30:15-19], He tells us the
                        kind of worshiper He seeks to draw near Him [Psa 34:18], the kinds of sacrifices He accepts and
                        rejects [Psa 51:17; Jer 32:35], who He gives His attention [Isa 66:2] etc. Without these
                        instructions &ndash; which
                        we find in the bible &ndash; anyone can come up with anything about God.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>False</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We can know God and His will from nature
        <ul>
            <li>True</li>
            <li><strong>False</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Obviously, this cannot be the case &ndash; given the explanation to question 10.</li>
                    <li>If we can learn about God from nature &ndash; as some misinterpret Romans 1:19-20 to mean
                        &ndash; then many problems arise. How can we know from what in nature we are to learn? Surely,
                        we cannot take literally everything
                        in nature to teach us about God. That would be chaotic and contradictory as many aspects of
                        nature contradict each other. Some animals eat dung; do we now say that nature teaches us that
                        God eats dung? God forbid.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We do not really need the Old Testament to be sound in our understanding of God
        <ul>
            <li>True</li>
            <li><strong>False</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The New Testament is an explanation of the Old Testament.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Gospels &ndash; among other things &ndash; show us how Jesus is the fulfilment of
                                the prophecies in the Old Testament.</li>
                            <li>The Acts of the Apostles largely shows that prophecy tells of the Gentiles joining the
                                family of God.</li>
                            <li>The Epistles serve &ndash; not just to give instruction to the believer &ndash; but also
                                to explain the prophecies of the Old Testament.</li>
                            <li>The Revelation mirrors and sheds light on many of the Old Testament prophecies.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The New Testament can be correctly seen as commentary on the Old Testament. What sense does it
                        make to read commentary to a book and ignore the book itself? How will one know what is being
                        commented on, if he does
                        not first read the book?</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When interpreting the Bible, we should be careful to harmonize our interpretation with our church&rsquo;s
        doctrines and practices
        <ul>
            <li>True</li>
            <li><strong>False</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scriptures were revealed so that we might obey them [Deu 29:29]. Therefore, our goal when
                        reading the Bible should be to understand and obey. If the proper interpretation of scripture
                        contradicts the doctrines
                        and practices of our churches, we must forsake the churches&rsquo; interpretation for the truth
                        and not try to harmonize them.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Any interpretation of the Bible that makes us uncomfortable or makes us afraid is not of the Spirit of God
        <ul>
            <li>True</li>
            <li><strong>False</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are many scriptures that teach that the word of God and the things He does, and commands
                        are revealed so that we can fear Him and do what is right [Deu 4:10; 14:23; 17:18-19; 28:58;
                        31:12-13; 1Kgs
                        8:39-43; Ps 130:4; 1Tim 5:20].</li>
                    <li>If God&rsquo;s words and deed are meant to make us fear Him, then it is safe to say that
                        interpretations of scripture that fulfil this purpose of causing fear are certainly of His
                        Spirit</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Paul and other apostles wrote their letters by the Spirit of God and did not really understand everything that
        they wrote
        <ul>
            <li>True</li>
            <li><strong>False</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A wise man is said to be one who knows the explanation of things [Eccl 8:1]. Wisdom, therefore,
                        is defined as the ability to explain things.</li>
                    <li>Peter referred to Paul&rsquo;s writings which &ndash; he equated to Old Testament scripture
                        &ndash; not as words dictated to him by the Spirit of God, but as words written with the wisdom
                        God gave him
                        [2Pet 3:16]. Paul displayed wisdom by explaining the prophecies of the Old Testament through his
                        writings. Seeing as they also explained the teachings of the Old Testament, it is not a stretch
                        to
                        say that the other New Testament authors also wrote by wisdom. If Paul and the rest wrote
                        through wisdom, it must follow that they understood the things they wrote.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>By the Spirit of God, we can have a better understanding of God than the apostles
        <ul>
            <li>True</li>
            <li><strong>False</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the explanation to question 15 shows, Paul (and the other apostles) wrote by wisdom. They
                        knew what they wrote, unlike some of the prophets who prophesied things they did not immediately
                        understand.
                        If the apostles understood what they wrote, then it is impossible for us to understand their
                        writings better than they did.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There are things prophets wrote that they did not really understand. <em>1Pet 1:10-12</em>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>True</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peter teaches that the prophets had to search intently and with the greatest care to understand
                        some of their revelations [1Pet 1:10-12]. That they did not understand their writings is
                        implicit
                        in the fact that Peter says that they had to study their writings to get understanding of them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>False</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The apostles were human beings and so we can disagree with their doctrines and still be Christians. <em>Matt
            10:40; Luke 10:16</em>
        <ul>
            <li>True</li>
            <li><strong>False</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jesus said that those who listen to the apostles listen to Him and those who reject the apostles
                        reject Him [Matt 10:40; Luke 10:16]. This means rejecting the apostles (i.e., their teachings)
                        is the same as rejecting Him. If anyone disagrees with any of their doctrines, he disagrees with
                        the doctrines of Jesus Christ. You cannot disagree with Jesus&rsquo; doctrines and be His
                        follower (i.e., a Christian).</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When studying the Bible, our goal should be? <em>Isa 42:18-20; Matt 28:18-20</em>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To understand what it is saying and align our actions and beliefs to it</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>God called His messengers blind and deaf because though they had seen many things, they paid no
                        attention. [Isa 42:18-20]. It can be seen from this that God wants His messengers to learn
                        and understand His ways. Similar sentiments are scattered all over the Bible. It is apparent
                        that God wants us to learn His ways&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Jesus commissioned His disciples to go out and make more disciples, teaching them to
                        <strong>OBEY </strong>ALL His commands. There is no shortage of scripture in both testaments
                        that command
                        people to obey God&rsquo;s commands</li>
                    <li>Putting these together, it is safe to say that God wants us to learn His ways and to keep or
                        &ndash; as the answers states &ndash; align with them. When studying, this should be the goal.
                        In doing this, one can and will find solutions to other problems but this does not mean that one
                        should approach the scriptures with a mind to find solutions or anything else.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To find answers to the problems plaguing our world and to help humanity</li>
            <li>To understand our denomination&rsquo;s doctrines and defend its practices</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
