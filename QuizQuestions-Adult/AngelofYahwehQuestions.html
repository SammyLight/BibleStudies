    <li>Who is the Angel of Yahweh<em>[Isa 48:3] This question has multiple answers</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Gabriel</li>
            <li><strong>Jesus</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When Joseph interpreted Pharaoh&rsquo;s dream, he said to Pharaoh that God had revealed to
                        Pharaoh what He (God) was about to do [Gen 41:25]. Pharaoh&rsquo;s dream was a prophecy of the 7
                        years of abundance and 7 years of famine that
                        were to come. This &ndash; according to Joseph &ndash; was not some prediction by God of what
                        lay ahead, but of what God was about to do.
                    </li>
                    <li>God speaking through Isaiah, says; <strong>I foretold the former things long ago</strong>, my
                        mouth announced them and I made them known; <strong>then suddenly I acted</strong>, and they
                        came to pass. [NIV'78 Isa 48:3]. God here claims
                        to have made earlier prophecies, prophecies whose fulfilment lingered until He acted then they
                        came to pass. This means that the things God prophesied earlier did not happen until He
                        <strong>ACTED</strong>. Had God not <strong>ACTED</strong>,
                        the words He spoke would not have happened.
                    </li>
                    <li>God says [Amos 3:7] that He does nothing without first revealing His plans to His servants the
                        prophets. This means that prophecy is not God predicting the future but God determining the
                        future. If God says through His prophets that
                        He would do something, He was revealing His plans. Plans are things that have not yet happened,
                        but one intends to do. So if God says He would <strong>DO</strong> nothing without telling His
                        servants, it means what will happen (i.e.,
                        the future) has not yet happened, it means God has not yet <strong>DONE</strong> what He
                        revealed to His servants, the prophets. All these teach clearly, that prophecy is neither
                        prediction of the future nor the decree of a man of
                        God but a revelation of God&rsquo;s decrees and judgments.
